I committed to Binghamton University and frankly I’m not sure which university is better for myself. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated and considered. 

Binghamton:
At Binghamton I will graduate with roughly 0 debt. I have also been accepted to their scholars program (top 3%) for Harpur and essentially can change to any major my freshman year (I’m thinking business and will have to transfer to the School of Management). I have also been accepted to their Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program (for environmental visualization aka drone stuff, but doesn’t have much to do with what I plan to study). I’m wondering if I graduate with great grades and at the top of the graduating class if I can land a spot at the top firms and companies. 

NYU:
At Stern, I will graduate with approximately 150k in debt or even more (oof). Stern is a well recognized school and target for many big firms. I am also confident I will land a paid internship my sophomore to senior year (definitely paid junior year). More than “prestige,” NYU has the perfect location for the business concentrations and finances I want to pursue. I’ve spoke with a few NYU graduates and they’ve all said that the only schools worth paying full price at NYU are stern and tisch. All the stern graduates and current students have highly recommended stern. I also saw that the mean salary is 85k out of stern and was wondering how long it might take to pay off such debt.",2,1589946983.0,/r/nyu/comments/gn47di/nyu_or_binghamton/,Advice

This option may include a combination of in-person and online classes and provide other services offered by the campus or global site. The Go Local option is available to individuals who hold citizenship or residency rights in the country that is home to a selected campus or site (for example: if a student with Italian citizenship were unable to come to NYC to study because of ongoing travel restrictions, we may enable that student to study at NYU’s site in Florence, or elsewhere in the EU). The Office of Global Programs will send out more information on this option tomorrow.

I’ve asked my friends in real life, and they do say NYU is isolating. But part of me wonders if it’s because there’s no campus, or because college kids are inherently busy, or because I’m not trying hard enough.

I find that I spend most of my day alone, despite having a large amount of friends here. It just seems like everyday is a repeat of go to class, study in a coffee shop, go back to the dorm. Party on the weekend or a dinner here and there. There just doesn’t seem to be common areas for people to hang around, whilst on a campus, I imagine you would run into your friends at the lobby of the arts building or whatever, or sitting on the lawn in front of the library. 

I wonder if it’s because I’m just ~~not~~ not that involved in clubs. But it really does not feel like there’s a lot of “violet pride” or love for this school. I actually even notice this in the NYU subreddit, as opposed to other schools’ subreddits, which are a lot more active.

1. Is NYU a good choice for biochemistry/technology (for example as compared to Uni. of Toronto). Are there good research opportunities at the school + the city?
2. Is the liberal core studies program good and well-reputed? I don't really consider myself to be that much of a humanities-oriented person so I'm a bit worried 
3. Does enrolling in Spring and Summer 2021 make it harder to make friends and find a community?

***TLDR: I tried the virtual computer lab and it couldn't run Adobe apps more than 2 fps.*** 

I'm a high school senior who will be coming to NYU in the fall (online or in-person). I was looking through all of the resources that came with my *shiny* new NYU ID, and saw that there was a virtual computer lab. I looked into it and it was hosted by Apporto, which is a multi-cloud platform VM platform. I was super excited, since my home computer struggles under multi-stream 4k videos, and takes hours to export longer videos. Though the wifi speed through the server was 2 GBps (which is insane) all Adobe apps ran HORRIBLY. The CPU was absolutely OP (it was a Xeon 24 core) but there was almost no GPU attached. Has anyone used the Apporto VCL, and did you have the same experience? Thanks so much.

My family is very new to this whole college experience, so we are all a bit worried about choosing which classes to select and they can't really help me since they don't know much about Business.

When I applied to NYU, I was kind of uninformed about the programs (which I admit is a 100% my fault) and I applied for Business and Political Economy. I realize that I 100% do not want to do this anymore, and would much prefer the Business program, as it allows me to choose from 13 concentrations.

I am aware that I am allowed to switch between the two after my freshman year. However, I want to plan my classes as carefully as possible so that I can limit the amount of extraneous classes I have to take as a result of this switch. I know it's a lot to ask, but if someone could help me navigate this over pm I would really appreciate this.

Also should I mention to my advisor before my freshman year that I would plan on switching?

Does anyone know how the difficulty / student life of each campus differs, especially in regards to CS? I know this has been somewhat answered before, but nothing in too much detail.

I’m nor saying I may be in trouble, but it seems pretty improbable that this type of company will simply give out private information about their clients to an institution just asking for it. 

Even the users can’t see what assignments we saw previously, why then can Chegg give this information to someone else without us first being able to see it? 

I honestly think this is all professors just trying to scare us into ratting people out or ratting ourselves out. Like yea it’s wrong that we cheated, but it’s also lazy of them to use problems that were already solved. We’re both to blame for this problem, but why relay the blame solely on us students?

Take precautions, change your email addresses, passwords, and privacy options. These are all things you can do on Chegg. 

I am NOT in trouble so I have no bias towards professors or students, but I believe both parties are to blame. Perhaps this can serve as the turning point for professors to being writing, you know, PROBLEMS, instead of robbing these from textbooks that have already been solved online.

-Institution name is much more recognized

-near city, packed and busy (which I like!), and nightlife in Shanghai is amazing and super fun

-can study abroad to nyc/ abu dhabi / paris/tel aviv, basically any other nyu global academic center, bcs they require a minimum of one semester abroad in order for u to graduate

cons:
-expensive as hell. (38k usd per year), i’ll be such a burden to my parentsss 😩

-I know zero mandarin, not rly into chinese culture :(

-I heard dorms there sucks 

-most students go there to major in business/ finance, dont think cs is theyre superior area of study


Jacobs University:

pros: 
-only 3 years of study to get a bachelor’s degree

-I’ve been obsessed w the german language for years now and I just love german culture

-more affordable (€9000 per year)

-can get a job bcs they give u work permit

-I heard dorms there are super great bcs theyre spacious and everyone gets their own room.

-lots of cs majors, theyre more known for its cs /engineering programs

cons:
-not a really reputable school, not a lot of ppl know it

-its quite rural (far from city), and I dont like being isolated I am used to living in a busy city! and based on my research it kinda has this lonely vibe.. it even has a graveyard beside one of the residential buildings.

-yes the tuition is cheaper, thats bcs i’ll be paying student debt for like 10 yrs with a 11% income share agreement (thats how the tuition I need to pay became way cheaper, bcs they move the rest of tuition with their tuition deferral program that u have to pay after u get a job that meets the minimum wage)

Both nyu shanghai and jacobs contains quite an international population (nyu sh consists of 50% chinese students and 50% internationals from all over the world, while jacobs has about 80% of internationals and 20% germans)


p.s: currently I am committed to nyu sh, paid the enrollment deposit BUT jacobs’s deposit deadline is on June 1st. which means I could still switch if I want to.

also, during my research I read a lot of negative comments about jacobs regarding that it is a subpar school for ‘ignorant foreigners’ bcs theyre stupid enough to go to a school that charge large sums of money while in germany there are lots of free public universities with better reputation/recognition.
however, let me remind you that most (or I think all) of those free public unis require German Language abilities of minimum B1/C1 and not a lot of ppl have that. (including me). thats why I applied to jacobs in the first place, bcs they teach in english. (just thought i’d share my point of view bcs I dont rly agree w ppl saying that jacobs is rly negative). bcs from an international student’s perspective its rly not.

I just got off the waitlist for nyu today! I'm really impressed with Stern and NYU overall, but I have some apprehensions, especially with regards to student life at NYU. I've also been committed to a different school for about three weeks now, so that also complicates things. I'd really appreciate if anyone could answer these questions I have about the school!

&#x200B;

1. How is the social atmosphere at NYU? I'm not really big on frats or anything, but at the same time I am kind of nervous about NYU's lack of a proper campus and a strong school spirit. I'm quite introverted and am scared about making friends/finding social events given how independent the student body seems at NYU. I didn't really have a fun time in high school and I'm worried I will miss out on sterotypical college fun if I go to nyu. One plus if I attend is that I'll likely be rooming with my best friend, so that might help initially. 
2. Is the environment at stern really as cutthroat as people say? I'm a pretty laid back person, and while I'm interested in business, I also love literature, philosophy, and writing. Stern seems very Ibanking focused, and while I'm not opposed to a career in finance, I can't really see myself working at an investment banks. Are job prospects (and specifically ones outside of NY) decent for non-ibanking kids? I'm especially interested in startups, corp finance for a tech company, or sales/trading. 
3. Do you enjoy being in NYC? I love cities but I feel NYC would be a bit of a sensory overload for someone who has grown up in a medium sized city in a flyover state. I did get to tour NYU and thought it was nice, but do you dislike living on the 'campus' long term?
4. Anyone familiar with BPE? What are career outcomes like? Is this degree any better/worse than a regular finance/business econ degree? I've heard it's a more closely knit program than the rest of stern. 
5. Anything I should know before coming here? The other school I'm committed to also has a very strong (though not as good as NYU) business school, but is basically a polar opposite in all other ways. It's religious, has a proper campus, not very diverse, is big on sports, and is less pre-professional. I think the cultural fit there is much better for me, but NYU is strangely attractive, if only for the reason that I would be so far out of my comfort zone.

gdyxb6,DhroovP,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/gdyxb6/how_does_the_college_core_curriculum_work_for/,How does the College Core Curriculum work for transfers?,"Hi /r/nyu, I applied as a transfer for the Fall 2020 term as a data science major. I expect to get my decision this Friday, but before then, I'm trying to figure out how my whole credit situation will work and I have a few questions. I've already looked extensively on NYU's website (as well as CAS' website) to figure these things out, but either I'm blind or it just isn't clear enough from what I've seen.

&#x200B;

To give some background, I'm worried about credits and how long I would have to spend at NYU because I am an international student, even though I go to university in the US and have gone to school here for like the last eight years (because H4 visa is a curse), so I'd be paying full tuition without any aid. So financially, it makes sense for me to attend NYU for two years, but if I have to drag it out more than that, it starts being a burden on my family and we'd likely have to start taking out loans.

&#x200B;

I will have 68 credits after this summer, and I know NYU takes a maximum of 64. The [data science major is only 52 points](https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/departments-and-programs/data-science/program-of-study-cas-bulletin.html), but you have to have a minor, which I plan to make economics, [which is 24 points](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-programs/bulletin/departments-and-programs/department-of-economics/program-of-study-cas-bulletin.html). That makes a total of 76 points, but I already have credit for Calculus I, Macroeconomics, and Microeconomics, which are 4 points each, which brings the total down to 64. Does this mean that I will only have to do 64 points worth of courses at NYU? How does the College Core Curriculum work for transfers? I will have my associates by the time I enroll, but I don't know if that means anything. I'm just concerned because it seems too simple (or maybe even too good to be true). I think I'm missing something big, but if I only have to do 64 credits, then I'll be attending for sure (as long as I get in).

Thanks!

gdibbu,justforwinterbreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/gdibbu/underclassmen_stop_giving_career_advice_or/,Underclassmen: stop giving career advice or commenting strong opinions about things,"tl;dr: Underclassmen stop giving career advice before you even have applied to a real internship/job and discouraging other people. This subreddit isn't the right place for career advice regardless of what anyone says. Period.

I've seen so many people post on here asking for career advice regarding whether a specific major would be right for them or not, school would be right for them or not, or even something like whether getting a job in a field of their interest is possible from NYU or not.

I get that now is a time when a lot of incoming freshman/some underclassmen have questions about career choices but with all respect, this subreddit isn't the right place to ask. Most of the people here seem to be people in the class of 23, class of 22, maybe even some highschool students who haven't even gotten into NYU. These people have barely had any real internship experience let alone a job experience but still here they are giving career advice or giving strong opinions on certain things.

I'm a graduating senior and decided to browse the subreddit because I'm bored before finals and saw at least a couple of posts from perhaps underclassmen interested in some field in finance. As someone fortunate to have had good guidance throughout the years at NYU which lead to landing a job I wanted and is highly desired, I know what kind of guidance made that possible. However, I still see some idiot from the class of 23/22 commenting ""No qUAnt isnN't PoSsible oUT oF underGraD tHis ISn't MIT"" or ""YeaH ThERE aRE 150 kinds dOinG IB oUT of STern"" like seriously? In what universe are both of those replies even remotely correct? The first one clearly doesn't know there are different areas one could do related to quant out of undergrad as someone pointed out in the thread and the second one seems to discount any other competitive applicant from other top schools applying for those positions. Most of you guys haven't had a real internship or are maybe a year or two away from even applying from one and you're going to give out career advice?

At least comment something remotely useful even if it's ""check out linkedin and reach out to almuni for informational interviews or ask people at wasserman to point you to right resources."" I can only speak for finance because I have experience with that but regardless of what you study at NYU, NYU is a good enough school to open doors at any career choice you want. Sure, NYU isn't wharton or something, but with the right guidance and by taking advantage of being in the city, you can do so much. Personally, I'm headed to a BB that many people desire to work at, I know of people who are headed to EBs that many people also desire to work at, HF/PE is rare out of undergrad but I know some people who still managed to land a role, some people even not in stern managed to land an amazing job that people in stern compete for, I've come across certain CAS students in my superdays at banks and the list goes on... You know what made that possible? **Proper guidance from people who could actually help and give proper, honest advice instead of just discouraging you. That is what will lead you to your dream job. Utilize the actual helpful resources you have, not Reddit.** Getting a job out of college is perhaps the most important thing, don't screw that up by listening to some bozo on reddit.

Stop acting like you know everything as an undergrad and grow out of the bubble you have attended school in so far.",182,1588620595.0,/r/nyu/comments/gdibbu/underclassmen_stop_giving_career_advice_or/,Advice

So this year I applied to NYU ED2 and didn’t get in. As you can probably guess, NYU is quite literally my dream school and I was gutted. I’m enrolled at Temple in the honors college, but was planning on reapplying to NYU next year. I’m trying to figure out what went wrong in my application so that I can fix it for next year - 1400 SAT, 3.81 GPA & hella EC’s [NHS VP, class sec, model un etc.] wanting to study bio and middle eastern & islamic studies. 

I feel like I had a strong “Why NYU” essay but now I’m not so sure. My common app essay was about having republican grandparents with a Pakistani immigrant father and I had lots of people read that too. Honestly I’m not certain what part of my app fell through which I’m trying to figure out. 

Is there anyone who transferred in who was previously rejected that has any advice for the reapply?

I did some calculations and the number of kids NYU accepted last year was 13,517. This year, they state that they had over 85k applicants with a 15% acceptance rate (so if they had exactly 85,000, they have taken 12,750, and if they had exactly 86,000, they have taken 12,900). Either of those, they have clearly accepted about 600 - 760 students less than they did last year, and I'm assuming they ended up waitlisting more of those kids. They most likely suspected that, to maintain their profile, they would waitlist more students to get a better yield. 

So in all honestly, combined with the fact that many students may not attend NYU due to the virus, lingering economic effects, and the tuition price, they are more likely to admit a lot more kids off of the waitlist this year.

These are some of my thoughts, feel free to let me know of anything :-)",2,1588159751.0,/r/nyu/comments/ga7qma/nyu_waitlist/,None

I agree with a lot of what's going on here, and NYU's response to the pandemic is far from perfect, times its downright embarrassing (the Green dancing video). BUT, I feel like they have given us a lot of reasons to be proud. They've swiftly refunded housing and meal costs, they've refunded a lot of the tuition for studio classes and they continue to provide housing and money for students in need. More than that, they've donated to COVID relief in the MILLIONS, sent over some 150,000 PPE materials to hospitals, donated food, allowed healthcare workers to live in NYU buildings rent free, stopped asking the mom and pop shops using NYU space for rent for 90 days. They're even paying all staff in full, even tertiary providers like our food provider etc. This is a really big deal in our current scenario. Frankly, I'm super proud of NYU for all of this.

The decision to put a stop on hiring and not do increases in salaries is very fair in the current climate. 

Some people are complaining about how the email contains no actionable knowledge and is purely an update on finances that should've gone to big donors. I'd disagree with that, I think its commendable how transparent they're being about this, with fairly regular updates. If they hadn't been doing this, people on here would be complaining about the lack of transparency. 

Yeah, there's a lot wrong with how they're dealing with this whole pandemic situation, and its important to recognize that and criticize them for it. But, it's also very important to put ourselves in their shoes, and see that a lot of what they're doing is the best they could've done IMO.

So I was accepted to NYU this spring but because I was in a year long contract working as a teacher’s aid at my old elementary school, I had to defer until Fall 2020. 
Then Covid-19 happened. 
I plan to wait until mid-summer to make this decision, hoping that NYU will put classes online and I can just take them at home (Southeast VA). My work contract is coming up to renew. I’ve already told the school I wouldn’t be back because I was 100% sure that I would be at NYU when summer ends. Now everything is so uncertain and I don’t feel safe moving to the city when there’s a huge possibility for wave 2 during the Fall. 
My advisor is working with me and says that he’ll help me defer another semester since I don’t feel safe (assuming classes are in person). My NYUstart date would then be Spring 2021. 

If classes are online in the Fall, I expect to take a full load since they’re all night classes anyways. If I take this road and then the Spring 2021 classes are in person, I would have to take a semester off (or possibly lose the opportunity?? Which I’m afraid of). This would be due to the 1 year work contract. 
If I take the other road, I’ll most certainly be home in the fall and I can start in the Spring in person assuming we aren’t on lockdown again. 

Should I risk signing on for another year with my current job since I’ll be in my hometown anyways? Will NYU be understanding in the Spring if I have to take a semester off?

I am an international grad student who got admitted to BU CAS's MS CS program and Tandon's MS CS program. Which program do you guys think is more reputed and worth the investment / experience?

On the other hand Tandon seems to be a well known program and seems to be more ""job focused"" and seems like a good enough return on investment. 

Either way, I wont be attending this fall and will likely defer, I just wanted to know if fellow Tandon students (grad / undergrad) had anything to say about theses two schools.  I really care about the academic experience, funding opportunities (TA/RA), job prospects, a good caliber of fellow classmates, campus life and how good the university tag will look on my resume -- so basically everything lol.

Also, I know most MS programs are ""cash cow"" programs for US universities, but I really want to attend a program where international grad students can integrate well into campus life and not be isolated.

* Has anyone heard of graduating early at Stern, and would you recommend it? I think there's a required course for senior Stern students so I'm not sure 
* is there any way of graduating early by supplementing the credits I get from my AP scores if I don't have enough? 
* would you recommend applying AP credit to skip electives (how much money would I save by fulfilling 8-12 elective credits?)

I’m currently an upcoming senior at SUNY Albany who chose not to attend NYU because of costs despite it being my dream school. Double major/minor in History/Anthro Judaic Studies/Hebrew, in PAT and honors program, GPA 3.7-ish (could take a slight hit because of the current situation, but no lower than 3.5) I’m now looking at attending for my masters and potentially doctorate, likely within Arts and Sciences. it’s in between NYU, CUNY Grad and Albany. 

My major questions are
1.) what is campus life like? What is there to do around campus? 
2.) what is financial aid like? I’m from a fairly poor area of Albany and only managed undergrad because it was fully covered and I have a job on campus

I am an international student.

I was looking at the economics degree in nyu and found out there was actually a BPE degree in stern, which i think would be more suited for me as i am hoping to work for an investment bank on wall street in the future.

A few questions i have for this degree are;

1. What is the main difference compared to CAS economics, would there be a significant difference in the area in which you work , and is it possible to apply to both stern and cas?
2. I have been reading around , and dont fully understand the course structure, would the course be going in depth into each aspect of B P E ? Or would it cover a general array of it.
3. Would all aspects of finance in stern be covered in this degree?
4. What are the odds of landing a job as an international student after finishing the degree.

I'll be attending Tandon in the Fall and while I feel very comfortable with my major, I feel uncertain of how Tandon will be for me in general. My worries about Tandon are as follows:

1. The quality of professors will be very mediocre. I'm worried that the professors won't care or can't teach well. 

2. The quality of the material and curriculum being taught will be mediocre. Basically, I feel as if students learning math or science at CAS will be given a deeper understanding and taught more useful things than at Tandon. 

3. The likelyhood of me getting an Internship at an amazing company(Google, Spacex, Apple, etc) will be very low.

4. People think Tandon is really Mediocre and that will hinder me getting a job.

This is gonna be pretty specific to me but may apply to others with similar interests.

Clarification: Cost isn't a factor. I am admitted to **NYU Stern** and **UMich Engineering**(non-Ross, weird right?)

I am planning on doing entrepreneurship/starting up my own tech/fintech business as I spent a large portion of my time on STEM during HS. Given this logic, I want to explore both STEM and business and both UMich engineering and NYU Stern would be phenomenal(UMich has Ross as a compliment in the business study and NYU has Courrant and high-tier compsci program). It is just that I don't know which one should I take a heavier focus on.

Some strong arguments I heard:

1. **School-related:** Opinions toward Stern undergraduate is highly polarized. I read negative ones: the competition is fierce and not in a positive manner; almost everyone wants to enter GC and MS; too professional/utilitarian.
2. **Education-related:** Business undergraduate actually limits the possibility for further education because it primarily teaches you ""soft skills"": leadership, communication, etc. On the other hand, if I focus more on engineering I would learn solid skills and ability, and I can better utilize the soft skills when getting my Master's degree in business schools. 
3. **Career-related:** Stern is well-known for its presence at Wall street, a powerhouse of IB, insurance, consulting companies, etc.  I admire IB and would like to enter them after undergraduate but it seems like Stern isn't very good at STEM-related areas but just the traditional ""old-money"" industries?

I am still waiting to hear back from both schools, but I would be an incoming junior at NYU or UCSD next fall. I have a strong interest in a profession in interaction design, assistive technology with a research interest in the Ability Project, and a personal interest in immersive environments. My background is in computer science as a major but I have a lifelong passion for visual arts.   


I like that the IMA program is a BFA, but have hesitations regarding campus life (I simply know more about UCSD) and questioning whether NYU would be a good fit for me socially and for my mental health--both are reasons in part I am transferring. At UCSD--other than enjoying the radiant sun--I'd be a Cog Sci/HCI major. My instincts tell me I am sacrificing the opportunities of studio-based coursework to fuel creativity, gain skills, and build a portfolio, but I would develop a breadth of content from my current cs foundations, the cog sci core, and design + interaction electives. Another caveat, I have not found any faculty that does assistive-technology driven design research. However, the recreational center resources, location, student organizations, and culture seem more fitting to who I am and what I want as a college student. Of course, NYU does win in most food and entertainment categories--can't compete with the fresh avocado oasis that is San Diego. Another minus at NYU I foresee is the commute between the Manhattan and Brooklyn campus--I am already experienced with a 20-30ish minute commute to campus from my off-campus apartment at my current college and don't love it. It feels restricting especially someone who has a pet I try to return to once in the middle of the day. Well, there's my thought vomit.

On my Albert it said I was ineligible to enroll for Fall 2020 cause advisor clearance is required.

So I was looking through my Albert page and found out there was sth called advising network. But wasn't sure if this was the same as the academic advisior.

A bit confused here, can anyone help me?

if classes are online, will you take a gap semester? personally, i wouldn’t pay tuition for online school- i do not retain information well just staring at my computer screen and doing an *entire semester* like that just isn’t worth the money IMO.

Took a single accounting class a year later thinking I wanted to do accounting. Completely changed my mind. I assume I failed because i never went to that class after the first day and never took any tests.

Been taking some programming courses and studying math and I actually love it now. Taking Calc I and II this summer and following it up with a physics course.

Wonder what my chances are and if i should even both. I enlisted in the navy in 2016 and I'm about to finish my 5 year contract in July 2021. Got to do some cool things but computer science in a 3 letter agency is the most appealing thing to me. The GI bill and yellow ribbon program, if i get into this school, should cover it.

I am currently a senior in Houston & am really stuck between UT Austin (McCombs as an unspecified business major & Plan II) and NYU Stern (Business Economics, would like to double-major/minor in Public Policy). I would really appreciate any input! :)

For background, I am very interested in a track that involves studying public policy & law school after graduation. I'm definitely intrigued by more liberal arts-style curricula and not so much by a career in IB/finance/etc. Here are some things I really like/dislike about each school, in order of importance:

UT

Pros

\- Affordable (!!!!) - especially if I eventually go to law school; NYU ends up being 2-3x more expensive every year

\- My ideal campus and vibrant campus culture

\- Plan II (interdisciplinary/lib arts honors program) curriculum is so cool

\- Know a lot more people going there (also a con)

\- Probably easier to get a higher GPA for law school admissions

\- Way more AP credits accepted

Cons

\- Probably not as much opportunity for recruitment, especially outside of Texas 

\- Don’t like being in massive classes (but I feel like having Plan II mixed in makes up for this)

NYU

Pros

\- NYC!!! obviously

\- More job/year-round internship opportunities

\- Small class sizes

\- Will feel more like a fresh start than staying in TX

\- More prestige (want to appease my Asian parents)

\- Tons of study abroad

Cons

\- Generally worried about social life (I'm pretty introverted lol)

\- Very expensive - my parents are happy to pay for it but it’s so $$$

\- Feel like super pre-professional/Wall Street-focused Stern culture might not be for me

\- Feel like I'll miss out on the typical college campus experience

Money isn't a huge issue, luckily, although it does play a factor. Is there a particular school better fit for my career aspirations? I've been so conflicted (having existential crises every night) and would appreciate any thoughts!

All my previous payments, including the down payment and the first installment of the plan, were paid via flywire in several portions, no problems at all. Just had to go down to the website to make the payments and a new payment option would come up saying that they'd take it from the money wired to them instead of only having the e-checking method (I don't have a US bank account).

All works fine 'till we all had to bail because of COVID-19 and now I get a notice saying that my last installment is late despite paying the money they wanted via flywire. flywire tells me everything went through, and the money shows up on my balance on the NYU site. Looks like they got the money. But I can't select the option that allows me to put that money towards the tuition? 

I had some correspondence with the bursar office which basically led to them telling me that they got the money *buuuuuuut* since the website doesn't work, I should just pay them again. The full amount. Around 4k. No information about what happened with what was already given to them. 

I'm okay with paying them again, but I got to ask, where'd my money go? It couldn't have disappeared, both parties are telling me it went through, did it get applied someplace else? Is the website just being buggy right now? What's happening?

I'm getting more and more frustrated by the second and I just sorted the balance details between 3/15 and 4/15, and it's telling me that that because of their ""refund to student,"" I owe them around 5k. In that same timeframe is the amount that I paid for the tuition installment. Did my tuition payment get sucked up by the amount that I ""owe"" because of the refund? Why the hell do I ""owe"" them a refund?

fz3fsd,ThrowawayRA987654321,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/fz3fsd/why_i_dont_support_universal_pass/,Why I don’t support Universal Pass,"Before anyone wants to start making the “socio-economic stigmatization” argument let it be known that I am low-income, a POC, who’s parent income has just been essentially halved due to the pandemic, but guess what? I still want my grades. Due to this crisis my days start at 6:00AM, and don’t end until 12:00AM, just to manage the work load of 6 engineering courses and I have a lot more familial and financial responsibilities. And with that being said, I worked by ass off to get the grades I have this semester and I should be allowed to be rewarded for them. 

Universal Pass doesn’t make sense because it strips the students who do want their grade of A CHOICE. Especially towards those who come from backgrounds similar to mine, who are making a countless number of sacrifices and still want to receive a letter grade.

What also doesn’t make sense to me is that those advocating for the Universal Pass, **will receive a “P”/“F” REGARDLESS of what happens**. So again, just as you have the FREEDOM to p/f a class this semester let others maintain the FREEDOM of having a letter grade, to take away everyone’s right to that is incredibly selfish.

We’re literally skipping like 17 steps here and not addressing the real issues that:

1) Teachers are still giving out assignments that have the same rigor of normal circumstances.

2) Receiving instruction through Zoom has made it more difficult to retain knowledge.

3) Many students lack the resources they would have had access to during in-person instruction.

If the Universal Pass were enacted **the # or % of students who will receive fails would not change or get smaller** either and it doesn’t solve any of the core issues that would still persist.

Let me keep the freedom to decide what shows up on my transcript.",101,1586605651.0,/r/nyu/comments/fz3fsd/why_i_dont_support_universal_pass/,None

Background: I’m non traditional (I’m older) and already work for a prestigious company in my chosen field. Finishing my education is a personal goal.

The problem is, I have a 4.0. I worked hard for that 4.0 and I’m worried I’m only pass/failing because I’m not to sure that I will get As in two of my classes. That isn’t to say that covid-19 hasn’t uprooted my life. I’m playing catch up in a few classes because I missed time preparing my company to WFH, had to relocate apartments, and honestly my mental health is failing.

But after a few weeks of these online classes I’m honestly considering pass/failing all of them. 

Firstly, most of my professors have been giving us more, harder and longer work then I had when I was actually at school since they think we just have all this extra time now. Some of the assignments have not been altered to accommodate being at home at all including a joint project I had to do with someone in a time zone 12 hours apart. 

My house generally has pretty good and consistent WiFi but with my whole family on and streaming I frequently have been losing connection and missing parts of lectures due to it. 

While I am interested in my classes and enjoy them, staring at a computer screen all day for lecture, homework, exams/quizzes etc. has been giving me massive headaches which on top of the issues mentioned previously is making me lose motivation.

I don’t even know how grading will work for most of my classes yet and in one class my final was changed to be almost 50% of my grade instead of the original 30%. Which makes the May 12 deadline seem like a joke since I will have no idea what my grade will be until after that.

In the end, I think I will pass/fail all my classes especially since it looks like a lot of other colleges are going for the mandatory pass/fail option anyway.

I heard grades are hard to get as chinese students get very easily graded. I also hearf that there is more opportunities for the chinese kids so I want to know if as an international student we would get the same treatment/support.
2. Recruiters/Employers don't know the school or thinks lowley of it since it is not nyu ny
3. just a question but is Internal transfer to NYU NY hard? I want to transfer if I dont like the school
4. Would it be worth it to go to NYU SH as a marketing major instead of UCI undeclared? 
5. UCI doesnt actually have the marketing major I want. Would it be better since it is a bigger school and all? I feel like they would not give enough support.

While I understand a crazy amount of reading is gonna be unavoidable with the class, I'd like to know which topic is easiest/has the least reading.

Also if there are any teachers that are really good, let me know.

I am also premed and feel that it would put me behind on med school applications if for my first 2 years I had to take mostly classes unrelated to the field I am truly interested in. 

Could I transfer to the CAS to become a Bio or Global Public Health Major during my freshman year/ summer before freshman year?

fuea71,heretobrowseandread,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/fuea71/stern_vs_washu_vs_berkeley_all_advice_welcome/,Stern vs WashU vs Berkeley!! All advice welcome,"Hi everyone! I’m having a lot of trouble deciding between UC Berkeley, WashU, and NYU to pursue undergrad business. For both WashU and NYU, I’ve been admitted to their business schools already and I’m aware that I’ll need to apply to Haas sophomore year. To give you some background info, I’ll likely concentrate in some form of management or economics and want to eventually end up at a Big 3 Consulting firm (ik it’s very ambitious). I’m leaning towards grad school but not sure yet. 

Berkeley: Career wise, Cal sounds like the best option because Haas is ranked ranked higher than Stern and Olin (#3 overall and #3 for management). I’m thinking this will make it easier in terms of job opportunities, but also not sure because I’ve heard Berkeley doesn’t have as much reputation in the east coast. Other concerns include grade deflation, actually being able to get into Haas, the overly-competitive/cutthroat environment, campus safety issues, and less opportunities with like research (being a public school, there’s a lot more people and less funding).

WashU: I love the vibe of WashU, everyone seems very genuine and happy there and campus is beautiful! However, Olin doesn’t have as high of a reputation, which could make finding a job more difficult. Additionally, St. Louis isn’t as large of a city as NYC or San Fran so probably less intern opportunities. 

NYU: One of my biggest concerns for NYU is that there’s not really a campus and that it seems very decentralized. I also feel like if I was pursuing finance, NYU would definitely be my top choice, but since I’m really not interested in finance at all, going there might not be worth it? But then again, NYC opportunities for internships are amazing and a lot of big consulting firms are in the east coast. 

*As of now, I’m choosing between NYU and Berkeley more so than WashU, but that could also change! 

**Cost of attendance isn’t a deciding factor for me

Thanks everyone, I’d really appreciate any inputs!! (Sorry for the long post—I’m planning to post this in the WashU and Berkeley subreddits as well to hear more perspectives)",1,1585940566.0,/r/nyu/comments/fuea71/stern_vs_washu_vs_berkeley_all_advice_welcome/,Advice

They gave me a financial aid package beyond even my most optimistic hopes. My FAFSA EFC is over $20,000, but NYUAD covered everything for me except flights. I intentionally chose it over New York because I know I'd be in debt out my ass if I went there. It's definitely the best deal I have.

I'm from the United States. I have an academic passion in the data science field (quantitative social science specifically) but I'm not sure how it fits into more narrowly-defined majors.

Hi Guys,
I'm an international student and have been accepted into the above mentioned programs WITHOUT any financial aids. I've done my research on the universities and have arrived at the following broad conclusions:

1. Both are Top 20 programs in AI/ML (which is my preferred concentration) (CSRankings says: UMass 11, NYU 20)
2. NYU is more than 1.5 times costlier than UMass
3. NYU is far more recognized by general masses but I'm sure that UMass is equally prestigious in the CS Community.

I will be taking a student loan for attending either of them but for NYU I will have to stretch a bit. So wanted to get an idea if the NYU experience would be worth the extra loan I will have to take.

Bottom line, would be great if you guys could help me see some subtle points that I might be missing in favour/against both of these awesome UNIs.

Will my GPA be the average of 3.5 and 4.0? (3.75). Or will it be recalculated to be the individual grades of 7 classes divided by 7? (Approx. 3.71)

If the first question is true, does that mean I should take advantage of P/F as many classes as I can this semester if I'm even the slightest unconfident?

I do not have special circumstances (like unfortunate family situations or having to return home abroad right now), so I was not sure if I would even be eligible for using this option?

focr5c,Inig039,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/focr5c/passfail_should_be_mandatory/,Pass/Fail should be mandatory,"This whole opt-in Pass/Fail thing NYU is doing is silly. It's trying to not let economic inequality heavily affect academic performance, but all it does is stop kids who are heavily affected by the Coronavirus from tanking their GPAs. Some kids will return to homes that are sitting on a lot of money and will be able to perform at the same or even better academic level as they did at NYU. However, others will return to homes in which both parents have been laid off due to Covid-19 and they don't know where their next meal will come from. Many of these less wealthy students will end up Pass/Failing their classes, and the wealthier kids will get the letter grades. The wealthier kids will be able to boost their GPAs, and the less wealthy kids will not. THIS IS NOT FAIR. We should not allow academic performance to be more a reflection of economic status rather than merit. Also, many employers will see that students pass/failed a class instead of getting a letter grade and assume they didn't do well or didn't try as hard as those who got a letter grade. One of the main purposes of pass/fail was to take the stress off of students. But it does barely anything, as many students will be just as stressed, as they would much rather have an 'A' than a 'P' and will work as hard as if we were under the regular grading scheme.   


Columbia, MIT, Smith, and many other colleges have implemented Mandatory Pass/Fail and NYU should follow suit.   


This article from the Chronicle of Higher Education better explains why mandatory pass/fail should be implemented

In freshman year I lived in a big suite, and my suite mates threw parties a few times a week.  I didn't mind, but on several occasions when things got rowdy the RA's came and wrote everyone up - myself included, even if I was just studying or sleeping in my room.  I didn't think much of it, since it seemed like everyone else I knew went through a similar experience.  However, this happened a lot in my suite, and it reached a point where I got written up about 6 times.  I contested all of them with the student conduct advisor, but I still had to attend one mandatory alcohol lecture.

I honestly forgot all that happened, but I'm bringing this up is because I'm applying to medical school and the application requires that I report all institutional actions that are listed on my transcript, and I know some schools consider this an institutional action.  Unfortunately I can't access my official transcript for a couple months, so I don't know if anything's listed.

&#x200B;

I'm currently in the military taking online classes with Penn State and am currently working toward an associate's in Business Administration with 22 credits right now. The Film and Business double major program at NYU is something that perfectly fits me, so I was just wondering if anyone has any advice or experience in anything related to this program. Is there anything a future transfer applicant like myself would have to do that differs from the normal application process? Would it be better to finish my associate's before I apply or would it not matter?

Asking everyone to come back from spring break and clean out their dorms is not only ridiculous but also dangerous. It's unnecessary travel that will only aide in the spread of coronavirus.

I hope everyone is staying well. I hope to get some help.

I have been working on my dissertation project and seeking additional participants . This is a short description of my dissertation project:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       International students,1st or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. We also got IRB approval. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors against** 

**for immigrants with fewer resources.**  **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.**  If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

NYU seems to be a more widely recognized school and I’ve wanted to live and work in NYC for a while now so it seems like a great opportunity for making connections in the NY area. AU also has a lot of connections to NYC but it’s not located in NYC and therefore it’s connections to NYC are probably not as good. AU also offered me an assistantship which seems like a great opportunity and the NYU program unfortunately doesn’t offer anything like that. That said, the kinds of skills I would build through an assistantship at AU (writing, research, connections, etc) I could gain through an internship in NYC as an NYU student. Thoughts??

Has anybody ever completed a certificate through Yellowbrick? If so, how was the experience? Was the communication good? Was the course itself worth the money? 

I just want to make sure my money is being put to use for what I want.

ff2izq,imissthem0untains,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/ff2izq/off_campus_housing_questions/,Off Campus Housing Questions,"So I was recently accepted into NYU’s Silver School of Social Work for grad school. I’m not a New Yorker (from just outside Pittsburgh, currently going to school in Philadelphia) and finding a place to live is very overwhelming. I don’t have tons of money, although there is a chance I’ll be deferring my admission for a year so I can work somewhere full time and save up a little. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had any advice for the best way to find off campus housing that’s affordable. As of right now I’ll be splitting the rent with one other person. Are there any websites that are particularly useful or any specific locations that you have found have more affordable housing while also being somewhat convenient? I prefer to live in the city but also don’t mind a commute, however I won’t have a car so commuting from Jersey might be difficult as I won’t be able to drive to a train station. Also I’m not sure if living somewhere like Jersey or Connecticut would even be cost effective in the long run because of transportation costs. 

Also how do you afford housing during school? Do you work jobs or just take out a shit ton of loans? I’m fine with working a job but from what I understand NYU’s social work program requires 2 days of classes and 3 days at an internship type program, so it might be difficult for me to get a lot of hours in if I’m working.

Sorry for all the questions! I really want to make this work but I’m not sure how to manage it with the money. Any advice at all would be super appreciated!",5,1583619240.0,/r/nyu/comments/ff2izq/off_campus_housing_questions/,Advice

fb8fph,_Lame_Duck_,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/fb8fph/wagner_mpa_question/,Wagner MPA Question,"Hello Reddit of NYU! Today I got my acceptance letter for the Wagner MPA program and I'm so so so happy!NYU was my #1 school and I'm just elated to have been admitted. I will be visiting for the admitted students' reception in a few weeks, but before then I wanted to see if anybody on here is/was a Wagner MPA student, and if so, you'd be willing to answer a couple questions I have.

Long story short, I'm basically deciding between NYU and Syracuse. Both are really great programs with Int'l Development concentrations that are structured, yet flexible enough to be tailored exactly to my interests. My long-term goal is to work in the Int'l Development/Governance realm (i.e. UN, USAID, etc) and obviously because it's in NYC, NYU is the perfect place to do that. I see that Wagner offers several ""study abroad"" courses over summer and winter breaks, which intrigues me a lot. In fact, I haven't seen a single MPA program other than Wagner that offers as many abroad opportunities that don't needlessly extend the time taken to get the degree. Has anyone done any of those and if so, did you find that studying abroad helped you career-wise? Additionally, I'm wondering if anyone could shed a little light on whether most students attend full time or part time; i.e. is Wagner flexible enough that if I wanted to work while going to school I'd be able to?

....which leads me main concern...money. Specifically the cost of living; how did you manage paying for rent on top of school (i.e. is it even doable to work at least part time while attending Wagner)? If I didn't have a job and attended as a full time student, I'd probably be looking at six figures in loans. Ouch.

I should hear about potential merit aid in the next couple days, but money aside, I am so thrilled at the prospect of going to NYU and can't wait to learn more in a few weeks while I visit.

I applied for NYU in Abu Dhabi for the full grant opportunity and did not make it unfortunately, but still I got accepted at NYUSH since I set it as a second choice, and now honestly I have no idea what to do. NYU was my dream college,especially Abu Dhabi with its financial aid opportunities, and I really could not believe that I can get in with my stats and everything, but now when Im accepted to Shanghai there are more complications regarding the coronavirus situation ( which my parents are really afraid of) , and of course, the financing. I got about 35K in aid, but its still not enough because our family will be able to contribute 25K at maximum, so here is the thing:

1. Is there any opportunity to get more financial aid now after the decisions are out??
2. Am I able to request for the transfer to another Campus?
3. Since this is not my prior choice of campus, do I really have [to](https://to.do) make my final decision until march 1st? ( Cuz many other colleges have deadlines much later, and I might get better offers\_
4. Will the NYUSH experience be worth the money that I am expected to pay in terms of further opportunities with career/networking? 
5. What would the coronavirus situation be in Fall 2020??? This is a main concern for my parents ( other than money lol) 

I am really clueless about what to do now, since this is obviously going to be a financial burden and the Shanghai campus was not really what I was aiming for, but still I feel that I could miss such a wonderful opportunity.... So any advice/tip on what I could do in situation might help :)

Anyways, another important thing to consider is that I am an international applicant from a ""third world country"" so I really did not think that I could get SUCH an opportunity in my life with US colleges...",5,1582135310.0,/r/nyu/comments/f6ek6u/broke_international_who_was_accepted_to_nyush/,None

I'm a journalist based with a major network news company in NYC. 

We’re currently working on a story about students whose study abroad programs in China have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak both in this past semester and in the coming semester.  

I was to get in touch with students about actions which may have been taken by the university to protect students from the coronavirus, as well as measures that may have been taken anticipating future study by students.

If you were in China through a study program when the virus broke out- what were your experiences like? Did the school or program help you get home? If you're planning on leaving for China soon, what now?  thought I'd post here to get an idea of whether NYU students have had an issue with this. 

We can maintain anonymity, PMs are open. Thanks so much.

Trying to decide if Tisch/Clive Davis new ""Music Industry Essentials Certificate"" is worth it or not.","I recently saw ads online for this Tisch Music Industry Essentials certificate from the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music ([link](https://www.yellowbrick.co/music/?utm_source=billboard&utm_campaign=edit)). It costs $1K and you can do it over 30 hours online at your own pace. While the actual info of these videos probably isn't worth the money, I'm wondering if having this certificate would be a smart move towards gaining creditability and/or connections in the NYC music industry or would it just be looked at as meaningless? Although this is an online course, would there be any way to leverage this into something that builds relationships at NYU or with other companies?

&#x200B;

Background (Sorry it's long):

I'm in my late 20s and, although  I've always wanted to work in the music industry but I currently work in tech sales which I hate. A few years back I was living in Denver and I did a couple of unpaid internships with very small, somewhat random places (A super tiny, upstart record label that failed, a small music PR firm in a genre I was unfamiliar with). None fo this panned out to anything meaningful. I should've clearly known more about the difference between a good and bad internship and done my research and I  should've also understood that Denver isn't a place to be if you're truly looking for opportunities in the music world. But instead I wasted a lot  year and money. Off the tail end of those let downs, I randomly met someone who was working at a  tech start up who offered me an entry level sales job on the spot and I took it because I needed an option at that point or I would have to move home. I worked that job for about a year and then ended up very unexpectedly moving to the NYC for family reasons (long story). So now I'm finally here but I've been working in Tech because it's the only thing on my resume that has any substance. Tt's frustrating because I know I'm finally in a place with opportunities in the music industry but I don't really have the connections or resume or even the awareness of how to move in that direction. Also I'm older.

When I was applying, the program seemed really great, and as far as the actual curriculum and faculty go it seems like a really solid program and a good way to get an edge career-wise (especially since there aren't a lot of great publishing opportunities here on the west coast; at least compared to New York).

That said, the more research I do on SPS as a whole, the less convinced I am — I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews online about how SPS has a lower reputation than the rest of NYU's schools. One post I saw on here even said that it was like the ""Devry arm of NYU"" (lol). For what it's worth, most of this info is 5+ years old and it seems like most of the negative attention was geared more toward the school's bachelor's degrees. I also haven't really found much negative about the actual program I was accepted into — that said, I haven't found a lot about the publishing degree other than what's posted on the school's site.

While SPS's reputation obviously shouldn't be a deciding factor in whether I choose to attend, seeing posts like this do make me a little bit hesitant, so I'm wondering if anybody enrolled in the program (or any students/ alumni of SPS!) might be able to share their thoughts on the pros and cons of SPS/ the Center for Publishing?

I haven't taken any college-level programming classes or tests before, so I honestly have no idea what to expect or where to ask. Are the sample questions about what I should expect for difficulty? Are there more practice questions I can find to prepare for this test? About how many questions?

However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I'm really excited to see it help student groups at NYU as well!

If any of you have any suggestions or features that you would like to see implemented. Please let me know!

For those who have already performed at their audition for any vocalist majors (Specifically classical performance) Please state how your experience went. What happened in sequential order and what the judges have asked you to do after before and after performances. You don't have to be a student at NYU that made it in but I'd prefer the people who have been accepted into the school and their major. Also, do you think your audition has helped or supported you in any way to get in? If so, what talent and/or merit scholarships did they award you? Okay forreal here are the last questionss lolz...

Is it hard to change majors at NYU and can we extend our range outside of our majors? It says so on the website that Classical performance can join with the musical theatre people, but I'm so confused about that so if any current students can explain in detail what they meant please do!

I’m a freshman living in Lipton right now and looking for someone (male) in Founders to do a bed to bed with at the beginning of Spring Semester. If you are interested pls dm me so we can discuss more details.

Reasons I want to do this bed to bed:
1. 90% of my friends live in Founders, and its easier for me to hang out & maintain friendship with them.
2. My job’s location is also close to founders so it’s a much more easy commute.

What you can get if you are willing to do this bed to bed:
1. Nice location. Lipton is super close to Bobst & most of the classrooms near WSP. Also i currently live in a lower floor which makes it unnecessary to wait 5 mins for the elevator when u are heading to class. Just a short walk down the stairs.
2. Roommates are super nice. Great to hang out with and usually pretty quiet & respect your personal space.
3. Dining hall inside the hall. No need to go out to get food on a snowy day.",22,1578833262.0,/r/nyu/comments/enn2aa/bed_to_bed_looking_for_someone_in_founders_hall/,None

I will pay about 2000$ for plan that covers from January 9, 2020 through August 20, 2020, but I will be back to my country the 20th of May.

egve4h,kaylamaxey,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/egve4h/is_nyu_worth_it_for_the_money/,Is NYU worth it for the money?,"So I got accepted into Stern ED and right now my issue is that I’m not sure I can attend because I wasn’t awarded any financial aid. I’m pretty lucky because my parents are giving me $125k for college, but with just undergrad being at least $320k before student loan interest it still leaves me at around $200k in debt. It’s my dream school and it’s just hard to have to think about letting it go for financial reasons because I’ve worked so hard for it. On the other hand though I’m not sure if possibly being in debt for a good amount of my adult life is worth it. I’m  pretty sure I can get some scholarships but I’m not sure if I can get close to the amount I need in them. So I’m at the point where I’m having to weigh what the benefits of going would be. I’m also considering Northeastern and Boston U but I’m not sure if I’ll even get in and if going there vs NYU will make a huge difference in opportunities. I’m also considering if I should go somewhere else for undergrad and then try for grad school at NYU. 

Sorry for the long post it’s just getting close to the time I have to make my decision and I’m still really unsure what to do. So if anyone has any advice for affording NYU or maybe how I should approach this that would be great!

I’ve also heard that you can get merit scholarships for later years but I’m not sure if that’s true(?)",28,1577563248.0,/r/nyu/comments/egve4h/is_nyu_worth_it_for_the_money/,None

English Lang - 5 

Physics I - 3

Basically I would like to submit my AP scores instead of the SAT. I know people on here are encouraging applicants NOT to submit a 3, but considering the rigor of the class itself and its pass rate, do you think it might be better than the SAT?

I am no moderator but I have been pretty active on this subreddit for the last year and a half or so and believe I may be able to vocalize some concerns I have personally experienced and what I see other users complain about. We attend the largest private university in the United States as well as one of the most globally spread and it's quite discouraging that our subreddit is relatively inactive amongst our current students and bombarded by redundant and easily answerable questions by prospective students. For some perspective, r/rutgers has more than 8000 less members but is bustling with activity. The overabundance of prospective member posts is likely deterring current students from participating in community building discussion. 

Here are some changes I suggest:

1. **New Mods:** The change first needs to come from the people able to make the change – the moderators. Most of the moderators, however, seem to have gone inactive due to having graduated or other reasons. I have only seen u/mrmbuceta be active in recent months and I applaud them for doing what they can, especially during the stressful Tandon semester. With more mods, the sub may not have to always rely on u/mrmbuceta to see the post or other users reporting ChanceMe's and admissions questions for action to be taken.
2. **A new sidebar and/or wiki**: Whether a prospective student or a new redditor, it can always be helpful to have NYU-specific information regarding the rules and function of this subreddit. A new sidebar would hopefully prevent the need for more work to be done by the mods. A sidebar such as the one sported by r/uchicago or r/rutgers may be informative to new and old members, directing prospective students to more relevant subreddits to them, including r/ApplyingToCollege and r/ChanceMe, thus avoiding the need to remove questions that belong there. Other information that can be included are Discord chatrooms, shuttle schedules, dining halls, residence hall info, the academic calendar, club info, and tons more. By doing so, I hope we could build towards a more complete community online.
3. **Post flairs**: Post flairs would work to organize and categorize posts as news, school-specific inquiries, memes, and more.

Please let me know if I missed anything that you would like to add or remove and I will do my best to do so! Let's discuss!

I have received about 5k in non loan money. Looking at my credit evaluation, I'm projected to graduate in the spring of 2022. I would be doing 5 semesters at NYU if I were to take a normal courseload and not fuck it up somehow.

I studied a double major in English and art history at my current university, and took a semester off on medical leave. If I went to Gallatin, I would want to study more in STEM fields and integrate that into my major, something that I have wanted to do for a while but couldn't because the rigor of the classes at my current university kind of make it impossible. I have very little debt since I went to a state school. I have worked freelance a bit and gotten a journalism internship, but I wanted Gallatin because I want to explore more of what's out there for me.

The cost is giving me some anxiety about whether or not this would be worth it. I'm already flexible about the idea of working off most of the smaller loans as I go and even being an RA or commuting from my home in LI if needed for a few semesters, but I want to know if any current NYU students think this is feasible. I also want to know if it's possible to graduate from Gallatin a semester early or if I need a reality check and I'm not even graduating in 2022. 

I know this decision is pretty personal and no one can tell me ""yes, go"" or ""no don't"" and decide for me, but I want to be prepared for what comes if I choose to attend.

I heard the campus is essentially just NYC. Personally, I really like big city living, but I was wondering if its hard to throw parties (very committed to the grind, but also parties), make friends, or just have any dedicated studying areas throughout NYC. Also, does anyone know how much merit extenuating circumstances are given because I have a GPA on a bit of the lower side (dropped from top 10 to top 25) , but there is a clear correlation between lack of grades and my circumstances? Also, is it possible to consult anyone about finaid before applying, because my family walks the middle-class line of comfortable enough to not receive FAFSA, but also putting 2 other siblings through college?

I was waitlisted (yes, waitlisted, not deterred) from LS this past week and have been pondering whether or not to accept the offer.
Just gonna list some various thoughts
- While LS definitely had a bit of what I wanted, I won’t lie by saying part of the reason I applied there was because it was on the easier side of nyu schools (Again, I still liked LS enough to where I would have been fine going there, probably would have moved on to Steinhardt)
- my 2nd choice school (GW) has an EDII option, and in all honesty they offer exactly what I want in terms of major (political communication). I also think I have a better shot of getting in there than with NYU
- I genuinely don’t know if I could stomach waiting 5 months at the minimum to hear back. I have some problems with anxiety and the mere deadline to decision wait this past fall was a lot for me
- I also don’t think I’d have a great shot at getting in off the waitlist, especially considering NYU historically isn’t the kindest with that

Essentially, I’m leaning towards not accepting the waitlist offer. I know anything can happen. I know there’s no real reason not to. But I don’t know if I wanna commit to this place further than I have cause I’m just sort of out of it right now. Is there any strong reason I should or shouldn’t go for it?

I'll be going to university in the **UK** (**I'm Bulgarian**) in September of next year. I've already applied and been accepted into 4 of the 5 unis I picked (accepted in **York, Surrey, Sheffield, Leeds,** waiting on response from **Southampton**, but I'm 99% sure I'll get an offer).

I want to study **CompSci** and since my end goal is working in the US. I want to use a MSc to jumpstart that (Visa, getting 3 years to work in the US post graduation so I've more shots at winning the visa lottery + I imagine a US degree is more desirable to US employers).

I'll most likely end up working through uni in a pathetic attempt to save up enough to get out without any financial aid (one of the reasons I'm going to the UK, is that while my parents are well off by Bulgarian standards - big house, luxury SUV, they can in no way afford the 9.25K GBP + cost of living in the UK, let alone the 60K + cost of living in NYC, so I'll most likely either work to pay for uni in the UK or get a loan, and they'll provide the accommodation, etc.), or at least a minimal amount of debt, maybe get accepted to NYU and get absolutely obliterated by the monstrosity the living cost + college cost are.

Really hope the UK BSc can land me a decently paying job (even 60K will be a godsend, I'll get 3 roommates and live in Alphabet city to save on rent lol) so I can at least cover cost of living and put away cash for the debt I'm about to pick up thanks to NYU, without being on the verge of homelessness.

&#x200B;

Fuck me the debt will be **crippling** even if I work while studying.

&#x200B;

What I'm wondering is, what's the best way to get accepted into NYU? I've got straight As, will do anything in my power to graduate from uni with a BSc w/ Hons, but I'm unsure which university to pick - **which one of the five is the most highly regarded in the US**? From what I've looked up, Southampton, Leeds and Sheffield are the best out the 5 and all rank within the top 100, but I'm hoping to get some input from people who've actually gone/are in NYU - hopefully maybe an international student who took my route?

Tl;dr: I'm Bulgarian, going to study CompSci in the UK. End goal is working in the US. Out of these 5, which is the most highly regarded in the US/will grant me the best chance of getting into NYU - Southampton, Leeds, Sheffield, Surrey, York?

I'm a writer for a student-run publication at NYU & am currently working on a piece about NYU's mental health/counseling services (I can provide more details over DM if needed).

I'm looking for fellow students who have used NYU's counseling and wellness services and would be willing to talk about their experiences and possibly answer a few questions for the article.

I've heard only around 600 students get into Gallatin each year. Likewise, if it is one of the less popular NYU schools that is applied to, does that mean that there is a higher chance of admissions or is it the same 16% as the majority of the other schools within the university?   
Also, if you're in Gallatin, I'd really appreciate it if you took the time to PM me so that I could talk to you about scores, ECs, etc. Promise I won't take up your entire day lol.

So I did the student exchange program in Japan last year, since we dont have an actual campus not many people do it, so theres not a lot of precedent for HOW to do it. More specifically im the first comp sci student to do it as far as I know

So flash back two years ago before I go, and im discussing with my cs advisor on how to make this work, and I ask him about replacing a cs elective with a math class to get ahead before I go, he gives me the A ok.

Now, once I finally get IN to Japan, I start giving him my syllabi for class approvals and its at this point when im ALREADY THERE that he tells me that I can only get credit for two electives. Im annoyed as hell, but it doesnt completely fuck my schedule, so I let it go.

Fast forward to today, and as im emailing him to get my registration clearance he happens to say ""By the way, three of your electives need to be taken in the cs department"" as in, the calc substitution I had taken earlier was getting pushed out by the classes i took in Japan. 

Your initial reaction may be, well duh, cant take too many ourside classes. Thats what i thought at first too, but I went through this with mt advisor, he approved my plan, amd has had SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES to tell me this as ive communicated with him and he only chooses to do so 4 days before I register for my last semester. Now I potentially wont graduate on time, or will at least have a hellish last semester.

I guess what Im asking is, do you think I have grounds to push back on this? I tried my best to plan this with him and hes been wholly unhelpful for years (I have a twenty five email long back and forth with him where I have to keep asking him just to answer basic questions) and I dont think its my fault that Im here now. Do you think I should try and go over his head, and if so who would I talk to? I dont think they even have a real ""exchange program process"" im pretty sure they just made it up as they went. Feels like I just stumbled into something theyre not prepared for and thats not mt fault.

TL;DR I kinda feel like my advisor fucked me over and Im wondering if I should go over his head to fight him on it.",9,1573203119.0,/r/nyu/comments/dtcpen/did_my_advisor_screw_meadvice/,None

First let me say that ALL information relating to CS electives is appreciated, even if it's not directly answering one of my questions. Also that I have already read similar posts in the past on this subreddit, but am looking for more opinions.

For context, I study CS and Math and am looking to work in Data Science (so the extent to which each elective pertains to Data Science is a particularly useful piece of information!!). Also helpful is the difficulty of the classes and how interesting they are, and how good the professors are.

&#x200B;

1. What are the primary differences between AI (Ernest Davis) and Machine Learning (Kyunghun Cho)? I am in AI right now and planning on taking ML next semester, but am unsure if there's is enough new material to justify taking ML.
2. What are the primary differences between Numerical Analysis (in math dpt., Charles Puelz) and Numerical Computing (CS, Margaret Wright)? Do people recommend these classes overall?
3. Is Natural Language Processing (Adam Meyers) interesting? I have a sense of its difficulty level but people don't seem to say a lot about how interesting the actual material is. Also, having taken AI (Ernest Davis) and Data Management (Joe Versoza), I am concerned that there might be a lot of repeat here also. Is the natural language side of things emphasised enough to make this course sufficiently novel?
4. Is Algorithmic Problem Solving very difficult? I heard it was graded competitively. To what extent is it helpful for Data Science?
5. Any other info on any electives please!!!!

Thanks so much for reading my long post. All info is appreciated :)

Hello all,

I've read the threads and I will not bore/annoy you with the common ""what it takes to transfer"" questions. Though I am looking for some insight on the open mindedness of admission faculty of NYU (NYU Stern specifically). I am a CC student, busting my butt to meet requirements and to create an exceptional resume (for being a 24 year old that is now finally invested in an education) for a chance at transferring to NYU Stern. My situation is a bit unique because I have had quite the... life. When it comes down to life experience and the discussion of such in the application and admissions process, how may the school feel about a potential student that has been working in an ""alternative"" field?

I have been struggling with some weekend slumps this year, meaning that I have had multiple weekends where I did nothing and never left my dorm. I have a decent amount of friends from freshman year, but I have had no luck making new friends in my transition from NYU London to main campus. The people in my building have been pretty uninviting and I haven't spoken or really seen anyone on my floor. I joined some clubs I was interested in but it seems they only meet on weekdays. Anyone know of any good clubs I can join that meet on weekends? 

I am a CS major and Japanese minor who enjoys both of those things, as well as video games, astronomy, drawing and painting, anime, travel, and photography. I'm trying to use OrgSync but I am having a bit of trouble finding anything and the site itself is a tad annoying to navigate.

I was wondering if y'all could help me decide if I should ED to NYU or my dream school--CMU. Before I start, I know my stats aren't super outstanding, but I am getting anxiety of being locked down to NYU in the very extreme case that I do get into CMU. I don't know if my situation is special or not but it is definitely complicated. The circumstance I'm under is that I studied and lived in Vietnam for 14 years (bc I'm Vietnamese), then I moved to Singapore and studied there for 2 years under their public education system. I got an O-Level grade of 10 which isn't spectacular but its good considering where I went to Singapore. I kind of lack extracurriculars in Singapore because all the students are to prioritize their focus into the O-Level Exam. I moved over to the US mid-year Junior year, so my Quarter 1 grades are missing from my GPA. Moreover, my school wouldn't add my grades from Singapore so my GPA isn't the actual GPA until the colleges I'm applying to do the calculations. I am doing the best I can right now at a competitive school and trying to use my senior year to boost my GPA. I hope y'all can help. Thank you! 

Here are my stats:

GPA (unweighted): 3.67 (not my actual GPA since I moved from Singapore to the USA and the school didn't consider my grades from my school in Singapore. 

SAT: 1420 

O-Level Grade: 10 (O-Level is like A-Level but for Sophomore Kids, it's much like a high school diploma over here. It is a national exam that over 80000 kids in Singapore take in order to continue their higher education)

Extracurriculars: 

\- Student council (Freshman and Sophomore Year in Singapore) (Kinda like class council)

\- Person-In-Charge of Robotics Club (Freshman and Sophomore Year)

\- Member of Executive Committee of Student Council (Sophomore Year) (So I was in charge of an aspect of the student council and oversaw the members in that group)

\- Participated in SASMO (Singapore Asian School Mathematics Olympiad) 

\- Participated in Research Competition at a Local Polytechnic (Singapore)

If a mod can change ""mentaller"" to ""mental"", that would be great.

I was hoping to get some substance use inpatient rehab level treatment and/or mental illness–psychiatric residential level care while taking an leave of absence from NYU, but I've been making a lot of phone calls and the person I spoke with who had the most actual experience working with Wellfleet (the company that underwrites the health insurance offered through NYU), a case manager who also had a background in mental health counseling, said that Wellfleet typically only covers 1-2 weeks of inpatient/residential level treatment or care (be it for substance use or mental health–psychiatric illness issues) even for the in-network facilities (in-network status aligns with the Cigna PPO Network, but Cigna does not actually pay for the benefits, but rather Wellfleet which I believe is often referred to as 3rd party insurance company).

Anybody able to share their experience or insight about this matter is greatly appreciated. You can DM me if you prefer that over commenting/replying.

I'm doing my best to access help but also trying to be realistic and make alternative plans/arrangements where necessary.

MIDDLE EASTERN WOMEN 18 YEARS AND OLDER NEEDED FOR ONLINE STUDY

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Long Island University-Brooklyn and I am asking you to be a participant in my research.  This study is designed to help identify protective and risk factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern/Arab American women. 

You will fill out a series of brief questionnaires.  This study will require about 45 minutes of your time.  Because the study focuses on Middle Eastern women, you are eligible to participate if you are a woman who is 18 years or older living in the United States and identify as Middle Eastern (including Arab or Arab-American from the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen).

If you participate, you can be entered into a raffle **to win one of twenty Amazon $20 gift cards**.  Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists learn about factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern women.   Research data in this area would also provide information that would facilitate the administration of culturally informed psychotherapy in this population. 

To participate, go to:

If you have friends who might be interested in participating, please tell them!

If you have questions about this research, please contact Amira Hanna at [MEWPH2019@gmail.com](mailto:MEWPH2019@gmail.com).

You can access the website from your computer at any time.  Participation is completely voluntary.

Here are some of my questions:

\- How did the MBA/MSc prepare you for a job in the biotech field? Where were you before the program and where are you after? (or currently)

\- Was there much overlap between the two programs? Did any of your classes cover the intersection of science and business? (such as bioentrepreneurship)

\- What are the advantages/disadvantages of the dual degree program vs. a singular program such as Keck Graduate School's Masters in Business and Science degree?

\- Did the MSc Biology intefere with the MBA events/extracurriculars? (Job fairs, networking events, etc.)

Over 1/3 of the school commutes and most go home on the weekends. Its also in a very suburban, almost rural area, internship opportunities are low, and most things close at 9. I have always wanted to go to college in or near NYC, specifically NYU, as my extended family all lives in New York and network. I applied to NYU last year and was denied as my SAT scores were not where they needed to be. I'm taking many of the basic gen eds this year along with some science classes needed for my major. I am planning on doing especially well this year so I can transfer and show that my academics have grown since high school. I guess what I'm most curious about is whether transferring to NYU is even possible in the aspects of transfer acceptance rates and whether they give any aid/ scholarships to transfer students (my family makes too much for FAFSA but not enough for $70k a year) and if transfers can easily assimilate into classes and making friends. I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who's ever been in this situation. Thanks!!",4,1567282478.0,/r/nyu/comments/cy09h9/transfer_to_nyu/,None

I'm wondering how the attendance policy in NYU is like, because in the previous universities i've went to (home university + others i've been on exchange), we have to attend at least 80% of classes otherwise you'd fail the class, but if you get a medical certificate then it doesn't count towards that %. So all in all I usually would miss 2 classes (use it to catch up on other schoolwork especially leading up to finals) and if i fell ill i would just go see a doctor and submit my medical certificate.

On hindsight I guess I'm dumb because I booked my long weekend vacations before knowing my class schedules. Still, is there any risk of totally failing a class because I'm missing a quarter of them, or is it more so of getting a not so good grade?",2,1567200582.0,/r/nyu/comments/cxn7sy/general_attendance_policies/,None

I wasn’t even in the top 10 percent of my class. There were so many comptenet individuals in my high school who deserved to be here over me. Why was I chosen? Is it just because I’m a minority? Did I just get lucky? Is it because my family had the money to send me here?

Most of the people who go here are smart people. They were academically high achieving students in high school who probably had shots at Ivy League level schools. I was not. Overall, I had a pretty mediocre application. I honestly didn’t take school super seriously until my last 2 years. Why do I belong amongst such smart people and hard workers. 

I can’t genuinely take pride in being a violet because I don’t think I deserved it you know? I rarely post about it. I don’t brag about it often. When I tell people I go here they get the perception that I’m smart and it makes me uncomfortable, because I feel like an anomally. Maybe the majority of people who got in are smart but not me. 

I’ve kept up good grades (3.8+), made the honors program, kept a good standing, joined clubs, but I feel like this is all facade. It’s a fluke. Do I really deserve this? Would I be here if my skin was different? Would I be here if my essay, ECs, etc we’re different? Did the AO just feel sympathetic?

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to juggle with this. I am insecure as it is and I guess my brain just finds ways to make me feel undeserving. Sometimes I feel like I should leave NYU and go somewhere more in my realm so I don’t feel like a cheater. 

Sorry. I need to say this. I can’t really talk to anybody in my real life about this.",3,1565909435.0,/r/nyu/comments/cqxeuw/rant_about_my_insecurity_going_here/,None

I am interested in getting into TISCH (the collaborative arts BFA) but I don't know what are the chances of me getting accepted. I'm in 12th grade right now, and I study in an Italian school in Chile. 
I've got an average final grade of 6,9 out of 7 in the Chilean scale and 10/10 in the Italian scale. So that's pretty good!
As for the final exams, here in Chile we have a unique exam called PSU, and I'm pretty sure I  will get more than 650 points out of 850 as a average (it's 3 tests: maths, Spanish and a facultative test of history/science). I will also be doing the Italian exam, and I hope to get at least 90/100. 
I'm not worried about the English test or thee portfolio, because I've done a lot of artistic projects during my highschool years. 

So, summing up, I'm an excelling student (academically speaking), but I am worried about the validation of the Chilean or Italian tests. I think that maybe the Italian exam is easier to convalidate, as it's valid in the EU, and it's graded in a scale of 100 points.

Or maybe my scores aren't good enough?

I am aware that going to my dream school will not fix all my problems and that there is still racism in NYC, but should I still view transferring to NYU  as a viable dream as a college sophomore?

I want to attend NYU and am currently in 11th Grade. I'm from a country that doesn't use GPA, instead we use something of the UK AS Level equivalent. My marks are slightly above average where I am, but I am worried they won't nearly be enough to make it into NYU. I can't find a specific listing of a minimum GPA requirement anywhere online so I'm turning to reddit.

Currently, I am just short of an 80% average (which I think I would be on a C+ symbol in the U.S). I think this is around a 2.5 GPA. It's very short of what the average is for first years, from what I'm seeing online. I have around a year and a few months left of school. 

Would these low marks even be reviewed by admissions or would I be immediately rejected? Will the fact that my marks related to the course I want to apply to are A's, or does that not influence the decision?

I moved out of NY to somewhere where NYU is only  known for being expensive.  Whenever I tell people where I went to school, the first thing they ask is usually finance related -- does this happen to anyone else?  

The questions tend to be: What was tuition?  How much of it did I pay?  How much did my parents pay?  Did I have loans?  Scholarships?  What was rent?  Was it really worth all that money?  They're often very direct about it -- as in asking, point blank, for a hard number.

I'm pretty awkward in social situations to begin with, and talking about money makes it way worse.  I don't know how to sidestep this question or naturally change the topic without coming across as either rude or embarrassed that I went here.  I get that it's something people are curious about and I don't think that they're being malicious, but I really don't want to go into the gory details.

But I would like to transition to investments, preferably in private equity or equity/fixed income security analysis.  

NYU’s MBA program offers many unique finance concentrations. I would like to do a triple-concentration because I think many of the courses overlap and would give me a good education in the field I want to work in.

· Quantitative Finance

· Financial Instruments and Markets

Other concentrations that peak my interest is the normal finance concentration, economics, and FinTech. **My question is would it make sense to do a triple-concentration in these 3 areas (bulleted above)?** **If yes, would you recommend these 3 specific areas because they seem more geared towards what I want to pursue.** **If no, do you recommend at least doing a double-concentration and if yes, which 2 specific areas?**

Like CAS vs Tandon vs Steinhardt, etc etc..

i have a 3.4 gap weighted (I know not very good at all but hear me out)

I take all IB classes and plan on getting the full IB diploma and maybe I'll take an extra math course online this summer to boost my gpa?

1520 SAT (maybe this will offset my ass gpa, taking it again in august so it COULD increase)

I plan on majoring in public health or anything following the pre-med path, but my stats are top tier of shit so will applying to an easier NYU college and then transferring be advisable (I don't need any financial aid if that helps at all)?

In terms of ECs I go to africa every summer to teach underprivileged kids english (which I genuinely enjoy) as well as created an artificial intelligence bootcamp catered towards local middle schoolers to increase futuristic knowledge, i also do other little things like volunteering at a local childrens museum, 4 yrs varsity swim, co-founded an activist club at my school, 1000+ service hours, play a leadership role in a government funded environmental conservation project, had some of my essays published by authors, and i've worked since my sophomore year to support my mom. Most of my activities revolve around working with kids so that's kind of my spike.

I feel like NYU is one of the few schools that don't necessarily allow numbers to define their applicants, but rather let the applicants paint their story- which is why i chose to ED at NYU.  I've always been mentally and physically abused at home, this semester i actually hit absolute rock bottom and was sent away to a foreign country against my will and ended up extremely depressed so my parents brought me back and re-enrolled me in school 2 days before IB testing, so I had to make up a months worth of homework as well as cram a years worth of curriculum for IB testing in 2 days. There're so many layers to this story and the effects of this will be engrained in me forever unless i hopefully get dementia soon, so would this be something good to write about? I don't want it to seem like I'm digging it out of my ass bc this is truly something that has hurt me and my mental health. I also was considering writing about a severe health issue that went undiagnosed until this year affecting my educational abilities, so essentially my grades are just a reflection of my brains inability to function. My parents are kicking me out and not helping financially if I don't get into any UCs or any other name-brand school so I have to worry about things I have never worried about before, any help to get my shit bangin would be so so so greatly appreciated!

Also, sorry if these are dumb questions, I tried the search bar and couldn't really find anything. Also, I haven't signed up yet, but I'm debating on it, I just wanna know a few things before I start the process.

First off, roommates vs single dorms. I'm okay with having roommates, but what are the pros and cons of both? Obviously the good vs bad roommate and being social vs not social aspects, but are there any other not so obvious ones? Maybe solo rooms have better management? Or shared rooms are safer in terms of area? 

Semi-related, I doubt they allow this, but if you had a single dorm/apartment style, could you bring a pet? My cat would probably be miserable at home due to my sister's dog being there for the summer.

What exactly happens in your free time? I'd probably only take one or two classes, so do I just hang at the apartments? Obviously you'll want to do homework, but there's more than likely times when you'll have nothing to do.

If you don't buy the meal plan, could you still hang out in the dinning hall and talk with friends? Or are they strict on who enters.

Do people have the usual dorm parties? I read that alcohol is allowed, I'm just curious if there's rules (like, do you have to show the RA or something whenever you buy any?)

If you end up with bad roommates, is there a policy on changing dorms? Or are you stuck for the whole time you're there.

Do you really meet friends? I mean, the type of friends where you all go out exploring the city on the weekends or go clubbing. Summer classes are usually for people who want to up their GPA/graduate faster, or highschoolers who are getting ready for college; all of which are probably wanting to focus on studies more than social life. I obviously could be wrong, but still...

Are the classes more difficult than usual due to the shorter semester? If you're only taking one or two, would it even matter?

I probably have a bunch more, but these are the ones that came to mind first. Thanks for anyone who answers, I appreciate it!",1,1559494225.0,/r/nyu/comments/bvzeq3/summer_course_questions/,None

I'm an incoming Graduate student at Tandon CS.

I am currently searching for 1-2 roommates to share the cost in renting an apartment and would be interested in working with me on getting a good GPA. My main strategy is to take easier classes to get the best GPA possible, and I hope there are graduate students in my field/major that share the same sentiment. It would be nice to work towards our GPA in the dorm together.

If you are interested, could you please comment? Please feel free to shoot me a message with your name and we can meet up.",1,1559275461.0,/r/nyu/comments/bv2vt5/searching_for_graduate_roommates_tandon_cs/,None

I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to ask these type of questions, but I hope you all will bear with my question anyway. I am a rising senior in high school and I am extremely passionate about business and drama. I would love to have the opportunity to study finance and drama at NYU, and was wondering about the process. I have read that the Stern-Tisch BS/BFA on the Stern official website states that it is a program open to students studying Business at Stern and Film and Television at Tisch.

&#x200B;

1) Do you have to be enrolled at the Kanbar Institute to be able to study at Stern as well?

2) Can your major be Finance and Drama

3) I acknowledge that it's only open to first-years, so what should I apply for in the fall as a high school senior?

bszfyg,arctic_moss,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/bszfyg/i_finally_graduated_so_heres_my_favorite/,"I finally graduated, so here's my favorite bathrooms at NYU:","(note: this list is not comprehensive)

&#x200B;

* Hands down, THE BEST bathroom I've ever found at NYU is in the Steinhardt music building (35 W 4th Street), 2nd floor next to the study lounge. This is a hotel lobby quality bathroom. Extremely clean, everything is automatic (and actually works), and it's single stall so you can shit to your heart's content. There is also an occupied thing on the lock so people know not to knock.  The study lounge next to it is quite nice as well if you need a place to study. A true hidden gem. 5/5
* Also, the basement of 35 W 4th has a nice, clean bathroom that is rarely used. 4/5
* Kimmel: the hidden one by the elevators is nice enough, but too many people know about it now. It offers double shield protection as it is one stall hidden by a door that locks. But whenever I go there, I find that people try and open the door, making it a somewhat stressful experience if you know you're going to be in there a long time. 3/5
* The best bathrooms in the Kimmel-GCASL complex are the single stall ones in the hallway between Kimmel and GCASL. They have the hotel lobby design and seem luxurious, but they are a little more heavily trafficked, so they are not as clean as they could be. Still, really nice bathrooms if you can snag one during class times. I'm pretty sure they are on floors 2-5. 4.5/5
* The basement of GCASL also has a nice bathroom that is less trafficked than the ones above it. Do recommend even though there are multiple stalls. 4/5
* Bobst bathrooms are absolute trash, avoid these at all costs.  If you need to go to a bathroom in Bobst, the only thing to do is go to the 10th floor where there are less people. But still, pretty much every bathroom in Bobst is terrible. 1/5
* Almost every residence hall has a single stall bathroom SOMEWHERE on its first or second floor. I know that 3N, UHall, Greenwich, Alumni, Palladium, Senior House, Rubin all have it. The only one I've tried to search but couldn't find was Weinstein (not talking about that monstrosity in the basement). Most of these you can only access if you're in NYU housing though. Quality varies, none are the best or the worst though.
* The art building (on Stuyvesant street past Alumni) has single stall bathrooms on every floor. These are pretty nice bathrooms, except some of the automatic functions on the toilets can be wonky. They also have free pads and tampons in stock. 4/5
* The Gallatin building has two single stall bathrooms on every floor. I cannot guarantee this because I haven't been to every floor, but it definitely exists on the 5th and 6th floors. These are okay, nothing great or terrible to say about these bathrooms. 3.5/5
* Another gem that I've found is in a building that I can't quite remember the name of, but it's on that block of like  Silver, Torch Club, and Starbucks on Waverly. I'm pretty sure it has the department of Systems Biology or something like that. Anyway, if you go in there, then go past the elevators and take a right, you will find two single stall bathrooms that are spotless. Amazingly clean when I went. 5/5
* The Data Science building on 5th Ave and 13th street has single stall restrooms on the first floor. Also has an underrated study lounge. These bathrooms are on par with the GCASL ones. 4.5/5
* Avoid the Silver bathrooms unless you just have to pee.

She took things including my Michael Kors wallet, a bunch of makeup, and other things I had bought from Japan and Korea. It’s important to note that a lot of the things she took are difficult to find in the States which makes it clearer that she most likely was taking my things.

When she was first confronted if she had any of my list of missing things, she said “no” to almost everything except for things such as my pencil case, pens, and mascara. It was only when she was asked to open her drawers that one by one my things started showing up. Her response upon finding these things were “I don’t know how they got there” or “That’s not mine.” And for the things that she did admit to having, she simply said that she either borrowed them or she used the same exact products as I did.

I filed a report and the confrontation was carried out by one of my residence hall’s staff and a public security officer. They basically told me that because I don’t have evidence to prove that she took these things, there’s a big chance she’ll be let go.

A former friend of hers had told me that other people have had the exact same concerns about her in the past which makes the believe that she really could’ve done this.

I’m not sure what to do after hearing that I’m out of options. I want her to receive proper sanctions so she understands that stealing is never okay and to prevent her from getting into bigger trouble in the future if stealing is a habitual thing she does.

Residential staff has honestly been so unhelpful. I can’t even be in the same room as her because I’m afraid she may lash at me but because I’m not in “immediate danger” and it’s close to the end of the semester, they can’t offer me temporary housing.

&#x200B;

So, I've recently received an admit from NYU Tandon and would love to hear your opinions and thoughts on the following matters -

1. I've heard that the courses offered are very foundational. Will this or has it acted as a hindrance for existing students to develop a niche in data science and get jobs there? If so, do students spend their time outside their classes to cover up this deficiency? Or, it hardly matters and is not a concern.
2. How easy is it to RA for data sciences? Do we need prior work experience or research papers to land one? or, are there instances where students managed to get it even with just basic knowledge related to the RA work?
3. Is it possible for us to take classes more than 6 credits from other schools or pursue a thesis/internship without exhausting any of the above credits?
4. What do you make of the opportunities available in the career fair over there? I've read that about 95% of the students end up with a job in Tandon. But is this quite high for data science and engineering jobs as well?
5. What do you think your friends or students you might know did right to get a part/full-time offer from established tech companies like Facebook or banks like Morgan Stanley? Also, Did prior work experience or research work play a major role in getting it?
6. Also, does NYU's brand name add an edge over applicant's from other universities?",2,1558041244.0,/r/nyu/comments/bpi8z1/opinions_on_nyu_tandon_ms_cs_program/,None

I was accepted to Stern BPE off the waitlist. I wasn’t offered any financial aid, but I am gracious to have parents that are willing to shoulder some of the costs. 

Now, I’m just split between if I want to dorm or commute. I am from the southeastern part of the US, but I have some family that lives in Queens. If I decide to do the 1 hr per way commute, I would live with them and save $20,000.

At same time, I really want to dorm because I am extremely awkward and just ridden with social anxiety. I feel that commuting would make it hard for me to reach out and make friends. Since I’m not from NYC, I’m not used to the long commutes and am wondering if that will take a toll on my time to study or limit me from getting involved. I also just really want a traditional college feel by living at NYU especially since NYU is already so open.

Like, all year. We have interacted a little for some required things like floor meetings and the agreement thing, but other than that we've never talked or hung out.

&#x200B;

I'm a very shy person and it sucks because I feel like I could have hit it off really well with my suitemates, especially one of them who I usually see in public because of class times and who I feel I would have a lot in common with. It was such a missed opportunity and I keep thinking of how awkward the suitemate situation has been and how much I've missed out on just because I was too shy or nervous to talk to them.

&#x200B;

This really applies to anyone coming in as a freshman, try to get close to your roomate(s)/suitemate(s) if you can. If they're not bad roommates and they seem fine then become friends, build a connection, and create something that might last. You're living with them for two semesters. I know a lot of people who are in a similar situation but not as embarrassing as mine.

People try so hard to make friends during their time in college and don't realize that their future best friends could be their own roommates or some other pretty obvious candidates.

Now knowing what path I am going to take, I’ve applied to NYU Steinhardt’s Music Business Program. I think I am a good candidate for the program as I am involved with the music industry (intern at radio station, music producer who has published interview, in a band etc.)

My SAT was good with a 1420, but my grades in high school were mediocre at around 3.35 perhaps, and my grades in college are about the same (however this semester has been very hard so they might be a bit worse by the end of this year).

I heard Steinhardt is one of easier NYU schools to get into, but I’m not sure how much that applies to the music business program. My friends, including one who applied to NYU as a transfer and one a freshman at NYU, seem to think I’ll get in because I got in originally. However, I am applying to a distinct program within a completely different school of NYU so I’m not sure how much of a benefactor that would be for me. Any thoughts?

On paper, it looks like I'll be able to graduate a whole year early before I even start taking courses, but I know that major requirements and stuff might kind of get in the way of me doing so. Given my major, will I actually be able to graduate a full year early, or will I just graduate normally with a ton of extra points?

\- What was your technical and professional background? Did you take the GRE? For context, my undergrad is in electrical engineering with a 3.85 gpa at state flagship, I have 3 years of cybersecurity experience as a naval officer, and I have passed the security+ and CISSP certs.

\- How connected is the school to the industry? Did the program offer you practical exit opportunities into cyber jobs in NYC?

\- Any other general thoughts on the program?",3,1555894395.0,/r/nyu/comments/bfvxn2/anyone_have_experience_with_the_online_ms_in/,None

Apart from the fundamentals like GRE and personal essays, I will also need to have a creative portfolio. In this portfolio, I will have to put up 10 stills OR a video among other things. I just need some feedback you guys, how good do the still needs to be? I'm a pretty okayish photographer, so I'm a little worried. How hard is it to get accepted into this program?

I'm an international student living in Shanghai who was recently admitted to the undergraduate Integrated Digital Media program at NYU Tandon. Before I lock myself in with a deposit, I'd love to hear some advice from Tandon students or alumni about your own experience (even better if you were in the IDM program!) Any advice you guys could provide is greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

GENERAL TANDON:

\-Are you glad you picked Tandon? Was it worth the hefty price tag?

\-Is being in Brooklyn a blessing or curse? How feasible is it to have a social life on both sides of the river?

\-Can you take classes at other NYU schools, and if so what is a typical ratio of Tandon classes to other school classes?

\-Which residence hall/rooming style is best for first years? How does the selection process work?

\-How's the student interest club scene? Do you find yourself jumping between Midtown and Brooklyn to join in clubs?

\-Any general advice you wish someone had told you before committing?

&#x200B;

IDM SPECIFIC:

\-Are you glad you picked IDM?

\-How much freedom do you have in choosing your curriculum?

\-What's the balance of Engineering to Comp Sci to Fine Arts to Communications classes you took?

\-How is the teaching quality and resource/internship access?

\-IDM BS/MS 5-year program, worth it or nah?

\-Any general advice you wish someone had told you when you started IDM?

I am asking for advice from strangers on the internet.  I know it is not the best idea, but still want opinions. Here goes.

I am a sophomore who regrets coming to NYU. I got a big fat $0 from NYU, and while at the time I committed, I thought NYU would open all these doors, I realized that my major has a shortage, so any school would have done. I knew this when I committed, so can not really blame anyone, but NYU is so greedy, and I will be paying off this for ages. I do not know if I should transfer out or just stick it through. I am Mechanical Engineering at Tandon. I feel neglected and like I am just a number here.  I am also sick of being told, this is not avaiable here in Brooklyn, you need to go to the Manhattan Campus. Bookstore? Dining Hall? (not to go like Jasper, which is not a good value for money) One on one tutoring like the ARC in Manhattan? 

&#x200B;

I know I should transfer, but since I am this far in, I do not know if it is wise to throw away $100,000.",39,1554594908.0,/r/nyu/comments/baajir/im_depressed_about_nyu/,None

b8egdt,trumpeterswanman,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/b8egdt/clark_street_dorm/,Clark Street Dorm,"I've noticed there is essentially no discussion about Clark Street on r/nyu or anywhere else, so I thought I'd list some things I've learned after living there.

This is going to be from the perspective of a CAS student. I'll be directly comparing Clark Street with Rubin Hall because I have experience with both, because many others have experience with Rubin, and because they have similar amenities. Specifically, I'll be comparing the Clark Street Low Cost Room for 3 in Studio (LCR3) with the Rubin Low Cost Room for 3 in Studio (LCR3). 

Clark Street Overview

1. The LCR3 in Clark costs $5,919 per semester. At Rubin, $4,250.00
2. The room I currently have in Clark is approx. 25% smaller than the room I had in Rubin.
3. The Clark bathroom is approx. 75% larger than the Rubin bathroom. The Clark bathroom countertop is colossal compared to the 1 square foot ceramic fishbowl in the Rubin bathrooms.
4. Speaking of bathrooms, there is not a single public restroom in all of Clark. If you plan to spend any time in the Clark common areas, you may need to travel 8 floors to pee...
5. ...if you can make it in time. One of the two elevators is never actually in service. 
6. Clark Street is actually just one section of a larger dorm called EHS St. George Towers. EHS (Educational Housing Services) is a private ""non-profit"" organization that does not care about your feelings and especially not your financial woes. Fortunately for NYU students, our rooms costs less than it does for everyone else. Non-NYU students pay $7000 per semester for the exact same room that I pay $5900 for.
7. Considering the dorm is filled with students from other schools, it's not surprising that there isn't much of a community. On a not so related note, I have seen my RA once in person. Briefly.
8. Rooms in Clark Street DO NOT have kitchens. There is 1 communal kitchen with 7 or 8 stoves for the countless legions of residents. It's usually packed and always repulsively filthy. Think the trash collection area on Greene St behind Weinstein. 
9. So far I have yet to meet another CAS student here. There must be at least a couple others. I think. I hope. I'm very lonely please help.
10. I don't know if this reflects poorly on Clark, but my current roommates are easily the worst I have ever had. I mean, everyone talks to themselves occasionally, but very few have terrifying whisper conversations with themselves at all hours while choking on their own saliva and chortling insidiously.
11. Clark has heat and air conditioning, but our thermostat only turns on when it feels like it. Some nights are Saharan. Others Siberian.
12. I've recently purchased an instant pot since the kitchen is in violation of EPA toxic waste regulations. I have gained back 15 of the 50 pounds I lost.
13. The room has a small fridge and a microwave.

ADDENDUM

1. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the Route A bus stop in front of Tandon.
2. The bus takes anywhere between 18-30 mins to get to WSQP. Unless your bus driver is pulled over by two very upset policemen. Then prepare for a 40 minute trip.

That's all I have for now. Feel free to ask me whatever you'd like about this paradise. I'm sure I'll think of some things to add. 

Also I would appreciate it if other Clark residents would share their opinions, considering mine may be *slightly* biased.

b7fghk,crows_eagles,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/b7fghk/admitted_student_need_advice/,Admitted student. Need advice?,"Hi guys!

&#x200B;

I was recently admitted to NYU, which was a great surprise.

I got accepted into Performance Studies at Tisch and got a $35,000 scholarship per year.

The confusing part is that I applied for American studies, but I allowed them to put me into this major as a second choice (they asked me in a random email two months ago, and I said yet so I could increase my chances I guess).

I am afraid that if I switch out of this major, I would lose my scholarship, so I will be majoring in something that wasn't really my first choice, and minoring in an area i'm more passionate about (or maybe double majoring? I haven't done enough research yet to see what that would look like).

Born and raised in Los Angeles, always thought I would stay in the west coast for college.

&#x200B;

Okay I gave that information as context for my main point:

Basically, I am choosing between NYU and University of Washington. NYU is an incredible university (which you guys all know), but I don't really know if I am a New York person. I never fantasized about looking at the empire state building outside of my window or rushing down the streets of New York to catch the subway. I am a bit scared of the (beautiful) chaos that creates New York, because I'm afraid that I would feel drained and lost.

&#x200B;

I am going to visit on the 13th to see the vibe, but I guess my question is:

&#x200B;

**Do I have to be a New York person to go to NYU?** And is it possible for a LA person (enjoys smaller communities, slower pace, competitive but not super competitive) to become a New York person?

&#x200B;

Sorry for this long post, I just feel so lost. My friends who got into NYU are DEFINITELY New York people. And my family is pressuring me to consider NYU because of the prestige and amazing student body, but I just can't help but think it isn't really me. Or am I basing that judgement off of stereotypes?

&#x200B;

Fortunately, I was accepted into Stern RD and I am really considering attending the school. However, I have a lot of question in regards to the atmosphere and potential of Stern, most of which I was able to find scattered throughout the subreddit to a limited, yet helpful extent, and I was hoping that I'd be able to get some clarity on these questions. So, here it goes:

1. A lot of people mention the focus on networking for those who want to go into Investment Banking-- how does this work at Stern? Is it cold emails and phone calls to firms, utilization of alumni, on-campus recruiting, etc?
2. How is Stern for recruitment into top-tier Investment Banks? Is it a target? And how does it compare with the Ross School of Business (this is another school I was accepted into pre-admit & it was getting a little hard for me to compare post-graduation prospects bc I couldn't find Stern's Undergraduate Employment Report/Placements)
3. How are the opportunities like in NY to find internships/jobs at IB's and PE shops throughout the year? Ofc, it's NY and there are opportunities there for those who are willing to hustle, but I wanted to know what the situation is given the fact that a lot of the people are heading to NY and Stern for a very similar reason-- Investment Banking
4. How is the student body & relationships with on another? Is it true that some would go so far as to sabotage each other (although I have no idea how that'd work grade-wise??? It's just something I read on Wall Street Oasis) Or is the student body rather collaborative yet competitive bc at the end of the day, it is Stern and we are all competing for similar goals. 
5. How are Stern finance classes in general? Difficulty-wise and preparation wise?
6. What are some of the things I can do as a freshman to make sure I am headed down the right path to have a successful career in Investment Banking (utilize NYU advisors, aim for certain internships, try to join in certain Investment Clubs @ NYU early on, etc.)

&#x200B;

I know these are a lot of questions & you all are very busy, but if you do decide to help me out, I'd be so grateful. Thx and have a great day!!!",10,1553922948.0,/r/nyu/comments/b77him/lot_of_questions_about_stern_esp_stern_v_ross/,None

But it is unfucking acceptable to openly mock these African people to their goddamn faces as if it was personally their fault for the bottleneck and not a management staffing hiccup. You made snide comments about how ""hard it must be to look at passports"" as you stood in front of these people, bitching about their lives and jobs as if they weren't there.

And then you took it a douchey step further and said ""This is why business school is like, so valuable, because like you learn how to do operations and like, logistics."" Yeah, way to represent your school, cockheads.

It’s the end of March and out of nowhere NYU took away my Tisch Scholarship. This scholarship has covered half of my tuition for all 4 years, out of nowhere it’s gone. I am a straight A student, no infractions, no warning as to why this happened. Now I owe the University thousands of dollars I don’t have— has this happened to anyone before?

The only thing that has changed is that I am a part time student this semester since I only have one class left (and it’s a year long film production class, I didn’t have much of a choice otherwise). However, that doesn’t negate the fact that my family has an annual income of less than $100,000 and that hasn’t changed. I desperately need that money, I have no idea what to do. 

I only have two months left until graduation, but if I have to pay NYU this money I’m not going to make it— I simply don’t have it. Will they give that back? Does anyone know what I should say? I’m going to the Bursar’s office tomorrow, is this even right for Tisch specifically?

Eng.,"I'm a current student in the Tandon Bridge to Computer Science. I had my master of computer science application filed before the deadline and I am on track to finish the bridge program in May. 

Right now, I am feeling comfortable in the bridge program. However, out of the blue tonight, I received an email at 2am from NYU Tandon Graduate Admissions, asking me for the permission to switch my application to Master of Computer Engineering. Part of the email is quoted below:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""the MS in Computer Science program is one of our most competitive programs, receiving thousands of applications each year. The Computer Science program is near capacity and we may not be able to offer you a spot in the incoming class. However, the faculty committee has identified you as a strong applicant to the MS in Computer Engineering program and would like your permission to review your application for admission into this program instead of Computer Science""

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So basically, it's saying that due to the amount of applicants, I might not get into computer science and it is asking me to switch to computer engineering for a better chance. But, I haven't finished my bridge to computer science program. How do they come to this conclusion/assumption?

&#x200B;

Now it's really making me worried about the prospect of my MSCS application. I don't know what to make of this email, and I feel a bit discouraged at my current bridge program although I'm doing okay. I am not at all interested in the computer engineering program. Any input from anyone would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for the help!

Again, I know no one on here has all the answers, but I am just so impatient as I have been dreaming about going to NYU for months. Their net price calculator estimates over 60k a year for me, and that is wayyy out of my range. Will my above average stats get me anything extra?

Don’t waste their time, of course, come prepared with questions and the like, but would highly suggest taking advantage of it. 

2. If you have the 225 flex plan for meals, use that shit. You never realize how useful it is until you don’t have it anymore. Also, make a friend and offer to take a junior or senior to lunch if you have a bunch left over. Guarantee 6/10 times they could use it. 

3. Making friends can be an intimidating thing. Best suggestions for making friends: join a club or sport, do events in your building, offer to study with people from your class, and in general go into social settings with an open mind. Almost all of the friends I made just because we all used the same study lounge and a couple of us are inseparable. 

4. Financials are a bitch, that much is for sure. If you genuinely believe you can’t afford it, don’t break the bank. Other schools exist. But I will say- there’s no harm in calling the financial aid office. I’ve had thousands of dollars in fees and other things waived simply because I called and said I couldn’t do it. Also, get in touch with Student Affairs when it comes to stuff like meals and not being able to afford food. 

5. Want a job + like dogs? Would highly suggest signing up for a dogwalking service. I made bank freshmen year doing that and usually never had to travel more than 15 minutes on foot from my dorm, plus hours are flexible + pups!! Additionally, use those job search sites and a lot of them have a “one click application” where you can submit a pre-uploaded resume and other stuff. Makes applying for jobs way less freaky. 

6. This sounds dumb, but go outside. It’s so fucking easy to get inside your head freshman year and I know a ton of people who would just hermit out. If you feel comfy, grab a coffee with a friend, or just go find a park to sit in (when its not freezing). Even just being in the sun and around people can significantly improve mood. 

7. AT SOME POINT, YOU WILL GET A BAD GRADE ON SOMETHING. YOU WILL NOT DIE. YOU WILL NOT FAIL. ITS OKAY. Enough said. 

8. Clubbing and going to bars is expensive. Especially in the village. Get someone in your friend group to get a fake, buy booze and mixer, and throw dorm kickbacks. Not dangerous in smaller groups and always cheaper and, in my opinion, way more fun. Also, chips and salsa aren’t $15 per serving. 

9. On the topic of less ethical things: remember, FUCKED UP or LOUD. You can’t be both at once, you WILL get caught. If you’re gonna send yourself into the stratosphere, be quiet about it. Pick one. Also, if you think your friend is in trouble, call Public Safety. The most you’ll get is a Saturday correctional lesson and a stern email. That’s not worth letting your friend die over. I l had to call ambulances on multiple occasions and I’m more glad that I didn’t lose a friend. I know people who weren’t as lucky. 

10. Take advantage of NYU’s free shit. Events will have free food and other little accessories, you can usually email your building if you can’t afford the copay for a program and get something figured out. There’s museum passes, a cheap AMC movie pass, and a ton of events will let you in for free just for having that lil purple ID. Life hack if you’re worried about food: most RA events have leftover food, ain’t no shame asking for it + they usually don’t wanna deal with it. I’ve gone home with boxes of insomnia cookies, face masks, burgers, burritos, etc. 

Overall, being at NYU can be fucking terrifying and really shit. Of course it can. Sometimes it just sucks. To all you incoming freshies: here’s to hoping I see you around campus! And to all current freshies: y’all are so close to the end of your first year. Amazing job y’all. 

Please feel free to DM me if you have any other questions, I’ll do my best to help + point you in the direction of someone who can help :)

Also, CS is very theoretical at my school and I wish I learned more applicable stuff. Any really bad annoyances about NYU? How are professors and classes? Do you feel like you have a lot of opportunity? Are there long commutes to class or is everything generally easy to get to?

I see how many events are at WSP compared to Tandon. There's so many fun events, free food, and other cool things going on there. They do not put much effort into student life here at Tandon. Want to go to an event? Too bad! the shuttle is delayed and you either have to take the subway or just not go, You probably will miss class otherwise.

&#x200B;

LACK OF INTERACTION WITH NYU MANHATTAN

There is not enough cross pollination with other schools. I wanted to meet people from other schools, isn't that what college is all about. All I see are people who can either barely speak english, hate writing and can't hold a conversation here.  I came here to meet people from all majors, but Tandon's isolation hurts us. But seriously, can't you get a TA who can speak English, and not Hindi or Mandarin??? (IK, not nice, but off my chest.)

TUITION HIKES WHILE ADMINISTRATION LIVES IN LUXURY

Financial Aid sucks, and even if your situation changes, they do not give  jack shit. And the Brooklyn student link center is staffed with the most miserable people here. I feel if you are not a certain race (mainly black or hispanic) or a woman or from a certain area, you are not valuable to them. All in the name of 'diversity"". It is insulting to them because it discounts their merit due to everyone assuming they got in due to affirmative action, which I know some only got in because of that. I have compared grades. It is unfair and disgusting. NYU just wants your money. 

&#x200B;

HIGH CRIME

I just saw a robbery on the subway yesterday, and without fail, see at least three people hop on my way home every night. And don't get me started on the homeless  (and insane people) in this area. We are right next to the projects BTW.

Know a guy who was jumped by some thugs by Willoughby, just a block away. And how about the shooting by shakeshack?

&#x200B;

NYU should charge less for Tandon tuition, perhaps $5-10,000 less, because we are missing out on so much that the Manhattan Campus offers. We are not separate but equal. Maybe President Hamilton could use part of his 1.2 million salary or rent out his $35,000 a month penthouse to help cover the difference?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Tandon fucking sucks, and you should not come here unless you are prepared to be isolated from the real NYU.

I  was appalled that there are still business running like a crime. They coax  & bully customers just for money. They called police on me to  prevent other customers in the store from hearing what happened in my seek-for-help-and-explanation visits.

**""Verizon"" on 52 E 8th Street, new york NY 10003** should be shut down since they really run business without any bottom line. All  the staff and ""manager"" are kicking things around.

They do whatever they can to get money. They charge random ""downpayment"" which goes to their own pocket.

**Before you walk into a Verizon Store,** please check on Verizon Website if they are **corporate store** or **indirect store**.

The  authorized  retailer ""mobile Guru"" was still listed as Verizon Wireless  on google map. There is no way you could tell as a newbie.

The only way you could find  out which store is the direct store is to go to Verizon's website to  check with the zip code: [https://www.verizonwireless.com/stores/storesearchresults/?allow=1&lat=40.732253&long=-73.987410&result=all&q=10003](https://www.verizonwireless.com/stores/storesearchresults/?allow=1&lat=40.732253&long=-73.987410&result=all&q=10003)

Authorized  Retailers aka ""indirect store"" is a private business  who signed contract with Verizon to be the retailer but **running business completely on their own**.   They sell devices with a higher price, sell you plans & devices  with  untrue stories under the cover of the Verizon's logo. Verizon  Customer  Service have no power over them for the solution. When you  file a  complain, *Verizon tells you to go back to the* ***same*** *store since they are ""indirect store"".*   Verizon will suggest you to always go to direct stores, but you could  not know until you ran into troubles which is already late.

Unfortunately,   Verizon had no power over authorize retailers (a.k.a. indirect store)   because those they are private business who paid for using Verizon's   logo to  get more customer but run the business completely outside   Verizon's system. *When you call Customer Service about anything happen in the indirect store, you will be sent back to the store.* The problem can only be resolved between you and THE store.

All the time, the staff are using this piece of sheet on the desk as the shield of every scam they did.

Based on the no-moral style in the store, staff there could  type a different versions if needed and you won't know. **There is no where indicating they are the authorized retailer, or mention their real name ""Mobile Guru""**

**All the Fraud/Scam in my case**

**A. Charged $150.36 in the name of Verizon but never went to Verizon**

I   was charged $150.36 as the ""down  payment"" as a new customer. The  staff/manager Shireen, an Indian-looking woman, told me the downpayment  will show on  my balance around 30 days  later.

* Later I found from Verizon

1. $150 never reflected on my balance after 2 months
2. Verizon could not see any record on their end that I was charged $150.36 (where did the money go?)
3. It   took Verizon 30 seconds to get my credit checking over the phone and I  had good credit and should never pay anything like  ""down payment""

I  sent my receipt (a regular print-out paper) to Verizon  Customer Care  & Staff from Verizon Direct Store to double check. All  of them told  me **the receipt did not look right**.

When I confront with the store, I was told by the same person (Shireen) **""you have to  sort it out with the manager, I have no idea  where the money went.""** & **""Verizon customer service could not see the  charge, but only the store manager can see the in-house charge.""** So apparently, the money went to their own pocket not Verizon.

**B.** **Refuse   to Accept Verizon's return Policy--> Stalling with avoiding and  excuses --> call the policy to stop me from questioning them**

I bought a new iPhone from the store when I joined Verizon. The market price is $799 while they charged $810.

When I  called Verizon Customer Care, I was told that my phone purchase date allowed me to return the phone by **1/15/2019** other than the regular **""within 14 days""** as the special promotion. **Verizon Customer Service confirmed that this promotion applied to ALL Verizon customers.**

When  I went to the store to return the phone on 1/14/2019 I was refused because ""they can't do it"". On the returning deadline, nobody is available to help.

When Verizon Customer Service Manager talked to the store- The store told Verizon they did it while told me I can't return again.

I visited the store on Feb.  5th. The person who called her self ""new manager"" (bright yellow hair,  rock-star makeup, tattoo on left arm) sat at a sales person's desk. (I  realized that there was either no manager,or Shireen is the head who stalling me by telling me ""come next time"" for the manager.)

When tried to put everyone on the call to sort things out, the **""new store manager""** **grabbed** my phone and **refuse to put me on the call.** She then made something up telling me ""no"" and refused to talk to me & walked away.

While  I was there, there was **an old lady in the store begging to get her  money back**.  She said she had been here many times and never get anything back. When I was talking to the lady outside the store, the ""new  manager""  jumped out and penetrated her arm abruptly between me and the old lady  kidnapping the lady telling me ""you have no right to  talk to my customer!""  **I  protected myself using a hand to keep distance between me and  the ""new  manager"" while she jumped out.** So unavoidably, I touched her arm. **She then threatened me that I was assaulting her and will call the police.**

I  stayed outside the store knowing they are getting extremely hostile. Meanwhile, the manager and  the staff guarded  the door in turns. The ""new manager"" holding the door stopping me to  enter the store. I told the manager I needed her help, **she said ""I don't care, I won't let you in. I am calling the cops.""**

When  the policemen arrived, I explained what happened. They told me I could NOT go back to the store any more even they understand how I felt. **It  is  ironic that Verizon Customer Care told me the only way  to  fix it was to going to the store trying to talk to everyone in the  store  until they agrees.**

Now  I realize how the store eventually got rid of victim customers who  survived from the forever torturing knowing the dirty business.

I was quite exhausted but also very sick and upset thinking how they bullied and played game with the old lady.

I   can not imagine how elderly, international students or people who do  not speak  good English could survive from it. I think most of the  people will give up and  call it bad luck because many times I felt this  way.

I never wanted my grandparents, my friends get tricked and feeling helpless.

What's  worse, it is truly helpless knowing how the crime was done while I  could do nothing much to protect myself and other people. This is so  wrong.

**Please help me and other victim customers if you have any suggestions.**

**Please help people around you by educating them about the store types and this particular trap store.**",27,1549607196.0,/r/nyu/comments/aodrdo/please_stay_away_from_the_verizon_pro_scammer/,None

I am fine at math, I just have to do a lot of practice and I do usually find it interesting, but I have never taken calc before and I am in MFE1 right now (although it has not started yet). I am a little concerned I'm choosing something too math heavy without ever being some genius, but I can still do fine as long as I push myself and work hard at at. I am just concerned about the amount of math-heavy classes, and taking them together. Since I started in LS, I am a bit behind on the major, so I know that I'll probably have to take multiple math-heavy classes at once. It is kind of hard to find exactly how much math and whatnot will be in each class, and if this might impact me if I'm taking multiple classes at once that are like this. So, I guess do you think I will be okay as long as I work hard at it, and also what do the electives look like in terms of the math? I have heard intermediate micro is the most difficult class, but then what about the other electives?

I might have to take MFE2 along with two other econ classes, which ones should I do? Like money and banking along with stats, or another elective perhaps? I am also considering taking summer classes to space it out better, I'm just concerned about taking too much on at once since I have not ever done so.

I'm going to be studying in London next semester, and I found out I will be dorming in Urbanest.

Does anyone who has lived there tell me what it's like, such as any Pros and Cons, cool areas to check out near by, etc?

&#x200B;

So I've completed 2 years of university in Australia (Total cost of 4 years would be $40k) but I've made the switch to NYU for the spring semester where I would need to complete about 3 more years (Total cost of $150-200k). Majoring in Computer Science & Economics both in Australia and U.S. I'm second-guessing whether it is worth it to finish my undergraduate degree at NYU. 

&#x200B;

Career-wise, I intend to work in an industry related to the joint-major and my aim, ultimately, is to work here in the US. It's likely that I will have to cover all of my NYU school fees through student loans (\~7% interest rate). The university I went to in Australia is one of the best in Australia so there isn't much of a difference in terms of rank.

&#x200B;

Taking all this into consideration, would NYU be worth it as a Computer Science/Economics major?",2,1548045731.0,/r/nyu/comments/ai6iru/is_nyu_worth_it/,None

It would also be weird if an engineering student at NYU Shanghai or Abu Dhabi posters replied to these posts but they don't and it's the Tandon posters.

First Tandon is separated from the main campus and they don't have the typical NYU experience so it's like saying ""I go to Fordham but I can visit NYU  and I know your major isn't worth it"".

Second Tandon is an engineering school and I'm pretty sure most of them have lack expertise in the area of humanities or art to gauge what is worth it in those fields. 

It's even worse of a bias in an engineering school since engineering generally has a higher STARTING pay but to determine worth solely on this factor is naive and arrogant. Unless you speak to alumni in your own major, it's hard to understand what the long term outcome is.",27,1544402427.0,/r/nyu/comments/a4ql5b/be_careful_listening_to_the_opinions_of_this/,None

a4kokx,killrjsdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/a4kokx/nyu_economics/,NYU Economics,"Hi there, I'm a high school senior from South Korea looking to apply to CAS for an econ or math-econ major.

Currently, I am planning on pursuing PhD in economics, particularly in topics regarding poverty and redistribution of wealth.

Here come my questions.

1.  I know CAS requires 128 credits towards the CAS degree. Assuming 4 credits are given per class, there will be 32 classes that I have to take to fulfill the requirement and that means 4 classes per semester. If I want to major in Econ only, 48 credits out of 128 are fulfilled. Otherwise, 72 credits out of 128 are fulfilled if I major in Math-Econ. How am I supposed to fulfill the rest? For the CAS core, I am exempt from foreign language, quantitative reasoning, physical science, life science, and societies and social sciences (AP credits).

2. I made a list of courses that I want to take:

\- MFE I, II, III

\- Linear Algebra

\- Analysis

\- Theory of Probability

\- Mathematical Statistics

\- Ordinary Differential Equations

\- Mathematical Modeling

\_\_\_\_

\- Intro to Micro & Macro

\- Micro & Macro Analysis

\- Intro to Econometrics

\- Poverty and Income Distribution

\- Labor Economics

\- Public Economics

\- Advanced Micro & Macro

\- Advanced Econometrics

That count total 20 courses in Math and Econ departments. Do you think I can handle above courses and graduate in 4 years? I enjoy math and I think I am pretty good at it.

3. I have AP Micro, Macro, Calculus BC (all 5). Do you think it is better to take AP-corresponding courses again just to review the concepts?

4. Is NYU Econ theory track doable? How math-intense are theory courses?

5. Are there any topics/concepts/subjects that you guys suggest to study before I take actual courses?

6. Are there any math-econ majors who are willing to share their schedules?",5,1544359062.0,/r/nyu/comments/a4kokx/nyu_economics/,None

To NYU:

New York University, NYU, the intellectual Mecca of Greenwich Village, the College Without Walls: thank you. Thank you for believing in the high-school junior from a town so small that, when asked where he was from, he’d simply say, “Massachusetts”; yet somehow people would still assume it was a city in Upper-State. An institution that receives hundreds of thousands of applications annually and had the gall to believe in the kid with a sob-story essay and an impressive ACT score, despite graduating 71st in his class, no doubt turning away hundreds of valedictorians in the same breath, deserves a “thank you.” Thank you, NYU, for allowing him the chance to break the cycle of poverty that had plagued his family since they were immigrant farmers in restless Vermont, and immigrant barbers in Western Massachusetts. Thank you for enticing him to accept your offer of admission with promises of guiding the first-generation students in navigating your bureaucracy. The aid package you offered wasn’t astonishing, in fact it was almost twenty times his expected family contribution; yet you provided access to loans that covered everything up front, coupled with grandiose visions of success after graduation. I am *sure* an institution as enriched as yourself was spread thin on allocating required aid to all the needy students you admit. Thank you for allowing him to grow in The Empire City in ways he could not have dreamt during his first semester. 

Yet all was not well with the new student. Despite his essay that detailed the uncertainty he’d faced his whole life, you could have not had *any idea* that he was slipping into the lowest of his depressive states with anxiety battering him at every turn. He may have reached out to his advisor and professors, but you heard none of it; it was never a worry until he became suicidal. Then, you suggested he take a medical leave. *Thank you* for offering that advice. *Thank you* for not burdening him with the nuances of credits attempted versus credits completed and the great deal of trouble it would cause him if he ever decided to return.

*Thank you* for allowing him to take a year-long hiatus to gather himself off your campus as you waited patiently, free from any liability he may have been. *Thank you* for allowing him to return to the city that once had once been home to so much turmoil in his life with open arms and contractual obligations that will regulate his future. Thank you for hosting the mentoring opportunity at your club fair that changed his life. Thank you for allowing him a second chance to flourish: gaining new friends, a job, and a deceitful sense of security. *Thank you* for holding him to a higher standard than his wealthier peers by stipulating his scholarship as a reward for the completion of a full semester; you put his place at the university into perspective. You never suspected he may face trouble adjusting back into university life despite knowing how long he had been away and the circumstances of the leave. *Thank you* for disciplining him by revoking his scholarship after one failed class in his first semester back; *thank you* for overlooking his 3.2 GPA in the other three classes he completed. *Thank you* for revoking this opportunity on one professor’s judgement of his aptitudes in Classical Literature.  *Thank you* for sending him back to that small town that nobody has heard of where he works nights in a warehouse to pay for community college. *Thank you* for $30,000 in student loans he must repay. *Thank you* for sending the $750 housing cancellation fee to his house, since he was not able to be in New York City any longer to pick it up himself.  

Thank you, NYU, for teaching him that achieving his dreams does not depend on an institution’s faith in him but on his faith in himself. You have taught him to not take his blessings for granted but rather to chase any and all opportunities presented with full force. *Thank you* for testing his determination with more trials and tribulations - as if he has not faced more than his share already. You have proven that earning stability through education while overcoming poverty, mental health issues, and a lack of institutional familiarity as a first-generation college student would be a formidable challenge. Thank you, NYU, for showing your true colors regarding your commitments to student success. You have taught this young student plenty on the harsh realities of being but a number in a system, and nothing more. Thank you, New York University.

My goal is to apply to CAS as a Computer Science/Mathematics Major for the Fall 2019 or Spring 2020 semester, depending on how long it would take to finish my degree. 

So a lot of ways that military students try to finish their degrees sooner is by CLEP exams. If you think you know a subject, say College Algebra, you can take a CLEP exam. It's a pass or fail exam, and if you pass, CollegeBoard grants you credits for that class. 

I have maybe 2-3 more semesters left till I graduate with my AA, but I've taken four CLEP tests, which gave me credit for:

\-English Composition I, and II

\-College Algebra

\-World Religions

\-Sociology

This gives me 15 credits, which also satisfies English, Humanities, and Social Science requirements for my local college.

I am also planning on taking Biology and Astronomy CLEPs to further expedite the completion of my degree, but now that I know I want to apply to/attend NYU, I'm not sure if I should. Per NYU's website, they don't accept credits for CLEP exams or any other form of ""credit-by-examination"". 

For anyone that might be able to answer (preferably previous students that tried to transfer in with CLEP credit):

1) Should I take these classes in person and risk not having my AA completed if I get into NYU? I would need to apply latest by the Spring 2020 semester because that is when my enlistment with the military ends.

2) Does transferring in with an AA carry any more weight than transferring with 45\~ credits? (In terms of credit acceptance/NYU's core requirement completion, etc.

3) Even though NYU doesn't give transfer credit for CLEPs individually, would they give me transfer credit if I completed an AA degree that had those CLEPs on my transcript? In other words, would they ""honor"" my current schools decision to count my CLEPs as fulfilling general education requirements? 

I ask this with hopes of not having to take any writing/humanities courses at NYU. I can write a decent essay/paper but I really dislike the process. I like Math a lot, and most of my classes here have been Math classes. Hoping to finish Calc III and Differential Equations by the time I get my AA.

We would like to know more about your interest in NYU. We are particularly interested in knowing what motivated you to apply to NYU and more specifically, why you have applied or expressed interest **in a particular campus, school, college, program, and/or area of study? If you have applied to more than one, please tell us why you are interested in each of the campuses, schools, colleges, or programs to which you have applied.** You may be focused or undecided, or simply open to the options within NYU's global network; regardless, we want to understand - Why NYU?

&#x200B;

So on Common App, NYU asked us what primary campus we want, and I answered NYC and thats it. Then they asked which School and major, and I said Arts and Sciences for a Biology major. The question after said if you are not chosen for your primary selection, do you want to be considered for another school? I said Yes, Tandon Engineering for Bio-molecular Engineering major.

&#x200B;

So in this essay question, should I be answering half about ""Why arts and sciences"" and half about ""Why Tandon Engineering?"" Or should I only be talking about Arts and sciences because Tandon is only my ""backup"" choice, which I am not technically applying to just yet (only if my primary school fails).

I initially started my college career in 2011, but being that I was suffering from severe depression and problems with drugs, I spent nearly two years consistently failing my classes, until I ultimately decided to give up.

Flash forward to today, I’ve been back in school for about 3 semesters, and I’ve achieved straight A’s with the exception of one B, though some of my previous shitty grades still linger on my transcript. Three classes (In which I achieved two C’s and a D) are currently bringing my GPA from a 3.75 down to a 3.25.

I have no extracurriculars, though I do work full time to pay my own way through school, in addition to other responsibilities I have outside of the classroom.

I have been told throughout my entire educational life by teachers and others that I have a natural talent for writing, and that I have a great “voice.” And it is true that writing; be it in essays, research papers, or creatively, has always come incredibly easy to me. Unfortunately, self confidence is not at all my strong suit, and I never thought of writing as an actual career.

My original plan was to get a combined BA/MA + Teaching Certification w/ a specialization in History at Montclair. My reasoning for this was ultimately a combination of the fact that it seemed the most feasible/realistic, and also they offer guaranteed admission from a NJ 2-year institution.

However, 8 weeks into this semester (first time taking 5 classes since 2013) I have surprised even myself in that I am still able to keep up, and so far I still have A’s across the board. It’s the first time in my life that I’ve been a full time student and actually done well. 

As a result, I’m starting to earn some self-confidence that I’ve never had before, and I’m worried that I am limiting myself to the confines of the student that I used to be, not the student I am today. Before 2017 I never believed that I was really that intelligent; and when people urged me to hone my skills as a writer I just assumed they were full of shit or just being polite.

Now, after proving to myself that I actually CAN do something if I set my mind to it, and realizing that all of my teachers were honestly trying to push me to my true potential, I’ve come to the thinking that I would like to hone my skills as a writer and see if I could really make it happen.

As far as what I would like to do with my writing, there’s a couple of paths I could see myself taking. 

While I could see myself writing some poetry (I write my own stuff already, not that’s it’s any good), or fictional novels, or even journalism.

But my dream is to work in a writers room for a comedy show, as most everyone I know sees me as “the funniest guy in the room.” (I put that in quotes because, as I said, I have very low self-esteem and actually really hate to put myself up like that) I really think that I could thrive if I’m put in a room with other likeminded people.

I know it’s pretty unlikely that I will be able to get in to a school like NYU with my current GPA, and that fact that half of my transcript from county is all F’s. But is it worth applying anyway? If I don’t get in to a great school now, I figured that if I can keep it up at Montclair, that I may be able to go to a school like NYU or Columbia to get a Master’s degree or something along those lines.

Does anybody have any advice? Not just for getting in to NYU, but what some good options are for someone like me with my interests and a “natural talent” for writing?

Any advice would be cherished!",4,1539795359.0,/r/nyu/comments/9p0g2t/should_i_apply/,None

**\[TL;DR version\]**

&#x200B;

**I’m a student coming back from military service.**

**Any tips on catching up with college life?**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\[Personal gibberish of an internet stranger for anyone curious enough\]

&#x200B;

Hello! I’m an NYU student, but currently on duty as a South Korean soldier. Long story short, I had to pause my studies because every able-bodied South Korean male is mandatorily drafted into service for 21 months.

&#x200B;

Now that 21 months is nearing its end, and I’ll be free to resume my life as an NYU student. The thing is, this time, I want to make it count.

&#x200B;

These days, I can’t get enough sleep. I lie in bed, trying to sleep, but instead, the regrets of the past and doubts for the future, they haunt me at night.

&#x200B;

I never joined any clubs or circles. I never kept in contact with people who wanted to befriend me. I never left my house to meet others. While I do not lack social skills, I guess I am a hopeless introvert at heart. I found comfort and relief in solitary and was uncomfortable engaging with new people. (which is something related to my childhood trauma) Then, duty called and I joined the military.

&#x200B;

One day, I was mindlessly daydreaming during lookout duty, and it hit me. There was not a SINGLE person who would be waiting for my return, or even further, remember me for that matter. Not a single “Hey, welcome back!” That made me ask, ""For ALL that time, what have I done?” I was suddenly interrogating my past actions for all the time wasted. College should have been a place full of excitement and potential! Instead, my memories of college have been a continuous stream of hopeless blandness so far.

&#x200B;

I think about what I should do if I come back to school. But it's too much for me to handle. I'm already plagued by anxiety as it is with readmission, ticketing, finding a house, VISAs and so on. 

&#x200B;

So I decided to write this paaaaainfully looooong post in the spirit of organizing my thoughts and to get some worries off my chest to a bunch of internet strangers.

(Possibly to get some great advice on the way if I'm lucky!)

If you read this far, thank you for tolerating my personal gibberish.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway, as a foreign student coming back to NYU, how do you suppose I do not make the same mistake?

Any tips and advice? Thanks in advance!

&#x200B;

I am a Australian, Undergraduate Uni student planning on taking an intensive course in January for credit at my home institution. I know that they don't release the offerings for January until October, but I am required to submit an application to my Uni with some proposed subjects for them to provisionally approve (its dumb, I'll have to redo it once they release the info..)

Anyway, I am having a hard time understanding where to find information on courses. I have found the public course search page (https://sis.nyu.edu/psc/csprod/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/NYU_SR.NYU_CLS_SRCH.GBL), but it still doesn't give me a lot of information, and it is essentially the most user-unfriendly webpage I've ever tried to use. How do I find out things like are there prerequisites to taking the course, such as previous study in a certain area, or specific courses beforehand? I have to send a URL link to a page with a syllabus/prerequisite information/term it is offered, all that stuff. At my Uni we have a 'handbook' that looks like this for each subject: https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2018/subjects/mast10005
Do you have any equivalent websites? Even when I google some of the subject codes I find on the public course search, I can't find anything about them.

From that, I also have some questions:

*  Do courses have 'levels'? At my uni, subjects pitched at first year students have subject codes starting with 1, and 2 for second year students etc. 
* How is enrolment into a course, and timetables managed? Do these open on specific dates? Is timetabling a first come first served thing or do you have preferences?
* For some of the courses they have waiting lists - does that mean courses sometimes have caps on how many people can take it? 

NYU obviously works a lot differently from my uni, so please tell me if I am getting this all wrong. I've tried to find out this information myself but I don't think I've been looking in the right places.
Any help would be really appreciated!! ",2,1537442128.0,/r/nyu/comments/9heer3/study_abroad_student_looking_at_course_offerings/,None

I'm considering submitting an application for NYU's MSL in Tax program but was wondering if any of you are currently in it or know much about it? How different is an MSL in Tax from NYU compared to an MST from another school (considering NYU doesn't offer an MST)? The course descriptions seem really similar to an MST and they are also very similar to Villanova's MST program which is combined with their law school. 

The only issue is that the admissions requirement is at least three years of work experience and I will only have two years at the time of application. I will meet all other requirements at that time. Does anyone have any thoughts? Is the two year experience requirement a hard rule or are they lenient? 

I've reached out to admissions but waiting to hear back. Figured I'd check with you all to get some details on the program from firsthand students.

NYU should standardize the textbooks and syllabi in some of the important core CAS CS classes.

I had a horrible discrete math experience and this was partially due to the new professor but also due to the terrible textbook. Even if I did have a new professor, I would've self-studied but couldn't since the textbook was just so bad. Using other textbooks wasn't ideal since it may put me at a disadvantage when exam time comes if different notations or unfamiliar terms are used.

My personal experience sucked while students with other professors had much better experiences. I think discrete math is a very important course in learning proof writing which is probably why I had such a difficult time in algorithms.

&#x200B;

NYU should make the calculus 1 and 2 sequence for CS more proof-based using Spivak or similar textbooks(Courant) instead of using Stewart. They should probably make the same changes for math majors too.

&#x200B;

I had a lukewarm experience with CSO and a real shitty experience with OS. I felt OS was mostly memorization with tedious projects and didn't really learn much from it. Given that the same few professors seem to teach these courses, we should just minimize the damage of OS and combine OS with CSO into one course. Get it over with as quickly as possible.

&#x200B;

They should make combinatorics a core requirement for CS and get professors to teach it.

&#x200B;

They should make abstract algebra a core requirement for CS with discrete math as a prereq.

&#x200B;

I believe Basic Algorithms at NYU is great but difficult especially when you have a shaky foundation like me and this is why proof based classes are so important when leading up to it (which the current curricula lacks).

&#x200B;

A lot of schools seem to be taking the CS is software engineering route, but NYU should do it differently and integrate more problem solving and math into the major. CAS CS should take advantage of the fact they are within Courant and have easy access to strong math professors and Phd students. The point of having these core requirements changes would be to raise the bar so that the curricula closer resembles actual Computer Science instead of being a boot camp (which alot of other colleges might try to be).

Credit-wise, the change isn't big and only 1 course worth of credit is added to the requirement.

CAS CS should make separate tracks with different core requirements or move the web development/database/software engineering track to Tandon where they can collaborate with Tisch .

If anyone could help answer any of my questions using personal anecdotes or research from their website that I missed, I’d really appreciate it!

1. If I’m trying to get my BBA (Bachelor’s in Business Administration) at NYU, would I apply to Stern or just NYU in general?

2. How valuable is community service to NYU? I’ve been unable to do much as I’ve worked a job for the last three years to help financially support my family (my family’s money situation won’t affect me paying for college, we have separate money for that)

3. Is a 3.8 Unweighted/3.93 weighted a good GPA for an incoming freshman? What GPA and other stats were you accepted with?

4. What are strong talking points for the essay, from someone who’s gone to NYU for business ?

5. How good is the business program there? It’s ranked fifth but I want to hear from a current student. Workload ? Internships ?

99uwld,GreenSour,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/99uwld/how_important_is_high_school_gpa_when/,How important is high school GPA when transferring from a CC?,"Good night everyone, hope you're all doing well. 

&#x200B;

So, a little background: I'm from another country, just became an US resident and I'm looking to study here in the US. I did not complete high school here in the US and my grades are not pretty at all: if converted to GPA(witch is not perfectly accurate since the educational system is different, the schools from my county focus purely on academics instead of a bit of everything), they would be 2.2 at my junior, raising to around 3.6 at senior. Not only that: I took 3 years to complete my last year because of my job(that is the reason that I was able to study in the US, money income and being stable was what will sustain me here). 

&#x200B;

Because of this, I decided to get into a CC in CA(so I can have a wider range of schools to apply to), and in these two years I will try my best to keep 3.8-4.0 GPA in college, do extracurriculars(the only achievement that I have is my job, other activities that do not involve improving your standardized testing skills are seen as a waste of time, so clubs leadership, sports, these things that you would expect from an American school are not in my resume yet) that would enrich my application, like taking anything at the CC that would have a direct academic impact(similarly to AP classes in high school), getting involved with my community through clubs(are there any in CCs? Excuse my ignorance, I still have a lot of research to do) and numerous voluntary services(it may sound silly, but since it is connected to psychology,  my major,   
 it has a bigger impact).

&#x200B;

I'm asking because UCs seem to ignore high school performance when transferring, and, from what I've read, NYU considers both. 

&#x200B;

Remember: I'm an US resident, so I'm not an International Student, but a domestic one with International Credentials. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading, hope you have a good Friday :)

Net Price calculator says NYU would be $33,478 minus room/board ($17,578) because I can commute so my total would be $15,900, and RPI would be $18,422 but that includes room and board.

For NYU I'd have to spend on new jersey bus and ny train which would be $235 + $121 = $356/month at 1 hour and 10-20 minutes each way. RPI would be a 5- 10 minute walk from the dorms.

Average job placement after 6 months for NYU is 84%, and RPI is 63% but that is for the entire school, not exclusively for my particular major.

I wanted to basically ask since I will be applying this coming December, are there any people out there that applied to both RPI and NYU? If you got accepted to both, what was the difference in cost and why did you chose NYU over RPI. Does your difference in price include the dorm/meals for both or commute for one of them? Is there something you'd recommend I consider? With the above stats what would you recommend I chose? My brother attends RPI and it really looks like a great campus but I just want a great degree. Comfort would be only secondary to me. Cost is important to me and if I commute to NYU it would make it within financial budget. I would need to take out $6k loans each year for either schools so my total loan amount would be equal since my parents agreed to pay everything after fed sub/unsub loans.

I like both 4 year Computer Science Curriculum and they look pretty similar actually. I don't know if I will get my master's but right now I'm 60/40 desiring to get a master's but things can change in 4 years. The reason I mention this is because each school offers a coterminal degree which means that they will continue my financial aid during my 5th year while doing my master's. But if I go to a different school, I'd have to pay the full cost.

Thanks

\*EDIT - correction, there is no coterminal degree for NYU. I'd have to pay full tuition for a master's but like I said, I'm not sure I want a master's yet\*",0,1533053208.0,/r/nyu/comments/93frz1/tandon_vs_rpi/,None

  I am a prospective Spring 2019 transfer applicant. Since I can't find any actual posts about it, I figured I'd shoot the question off to the people already there.

  Should I mention I'm deaf within my application essays or should I just keep that to myself? There are no interviews required when applying, so I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. 

  I'm asking because it really has nothing to do with why I am applying to NYU as a transfer, but it's also the only college I'm applying to so I really want to give myself the best chances possible. My GPA isn't the best, so I need that extra ""oomph"".

  I know some people base their essays off of disabilities/mental illnesses/etc., but I don't know if it would put me at a disadvantage beacause I'm not as easily accommodated. Did you mention or write your essays about disabilities/mental illnesses/etc.? What were yours about?

I like moving around and the American North Eastern Seaboard is a place I’ve never really lived so when thinking of where I’d like to do grad school Brooklyn was a place that peeked my interest.  The primary reason I’m looking at Brooklyn is because I’m a Ukrainian orphan, I was adopted and taken to the United States around age 10 and I really miss my home.  Unfortunately it is in my financial interest to stay in the United States.  SO since I’m getting to the point in my Undergraduate work where I need to start looking into specifically where I want to go I’m reaching out and attempting to get first hand opinions about what it is like to attend your school and live in your area.  NYU Tandon is my top choice location wise and I know that for the areas of CS I specialize in [AI and Algorithm Optimization] the career opportunities for persons who hold an M.S or Ph.D are more abundant than most places in the country.  

So school me up on what you think I ought to know.  Tell me I am a naive little country mouse and that the brutal mortar of the city will grind me into nothingness.

I want to know if I still have a chance. Here's my situation:

Ever since elementary school, I've always been a B-C student. I was being a dumb kid, and didn't see the bigger picture of how important grades are in order to pursue my career in fine art at an educational level. When my dream performing arts high school didn't accept me (twice) I got super depressed and handled it like shit. Stayed a B-C student throughout high school, fell into an even rougher ditch in the middle of tenth grade when my father got injured, and I moved up to western NY. I now go to the only performing arts school in the city, and have been taking art classes. Still stayed a B-C student, and it was only until recently that I had an apiphany about life (even got the weight loss to prove it, lol) and...here we are. I don't know my exact GPA yet, but I predict its at the 2.7-3.0 range (and admittedly that's a tad optimistic). 

Thankfully I don't think it's all too bad. I took my Algebra and Living Env./Biology Regents in eighth grade, achieving a 70 and 77 respectively. I proceeded to get modest Regents grades (highest being a 92 in one of them, lowest a 68 in 3, with 3 more I have to do this month), and was a year ahead in math and science. When I complete my Regents this month, I'll already be legible for an Advanced Regents Diploma (if that hopefully means anything). I also got a 1260 on my SAT. I'm working on my art portfolio right now, here are the five pieces I have so far: https://imgur.com/a/oF4u9gR (forgive the crappy image quality)

Next year I'm going to take AP Global History, and plan on truly trying my best. What do you think my odds are of me getting in? Thank you for sticking this long.

TL;DR, Got low grades, can draw pretty well and got a good sat score with meager gpa, what can I do to further my chances?",1,1528592225.0,/r/nyu/comments/8pxd4m/im_a_junior_about_to_be_a_senior_who_wants_to_go/,None

I'm super excited to be attending and having it to look forward to is probably one of the only things preventing me from deep sadness. However, I have had a couple issues:

1) Cost - This school is so expensive. I am paying more for one year here than a lot of my friends. I didn't get any financial aid, probably because my family is upper class tbh. Do most people pay full price? I'm worried about being in a ton of debt. Also, what if the cost becomes too much and I have to drop out? Will this degree be worth the price?

2) Heading far away from home - I am moving all the way across the country to attend. My family has some issues, but it scares me that I am leaving them. I'm going to be alone for the most part.

3) Friends - pretty much none of my friends are going out of state and none are going to NYU. I always hear people complain about it being hard to make friends at NYU too. I don't want to be a complete loner. 

4) Academics - Will this school be too hard for me? I'm doing CAS and I'm nervous that I will do bad in my core classes. I don't want to ruin my GPA.

Overall, this is the start of something amazing and I am VERY VERY excited to attend. This was my top choice and it is an absolute privilege to attend. I don't regret my decision to attend. I wouldn't have it any other way. This is the start of something amazing. These are only a few issues that I am having.

I go to an international school in mainland China. For year 11-12 the school offers only the IB curriculum. However according to the school we will get 3 diplomas when we graduate: one from IB, one from the school, and one from the local government for finishing 4 government courses. 
I’m pretty sure I’ve secured the government diploma, and I hear from the last year of graduates(which is also our first) everyone got their school diplomas whether or not they got the IB one. 

When applying I provided my ACT score (34) along with my IB predicted (28). Was accepted ED1 to LSP. 
I dropped 3 points IIRC on my mid year, getting me an email of warning from NYU. For the last semester, both the midterm and the final grades (for the term) came out in April and I got 32/31. I believe the school says both these grades will be send to our unis along with the IB final test scores. 

I’m worried about my math being a failure as it is also one of my HLs, and I also messed up biology paper 1 today. What happens if I don’t get my diploma under such circumstances?? Other HLs are Chinese A and English A, along w/ music and history SL.

Also: my school does not calculate GPA. I know it’s super weird but our head of academics just says that we don’t have GPAs and the unis will have to convert whatever the school sends them to a 4-point scale.

How competitive is the game design MFA to get into assuming I have the grades to get accepted into NYU on average? (What level do the projects in the portfolio need to be at?)

If I am interested in the computer science side of Game Development, would I want to dual major in Game Dev and Comp Sci (is that even possible?) or is Game Dev sufficient?

When in the game design program, how college-y is it? By that I mean is it similar to most liberal arts colleges where there is a sense of community and interconnectedness or are each school like their own little college?

I just wanted to let you know that I appreciated your help. Even more so, as I was working out, I couldn't help but notice your tight butt and your smile, the creases of your skin when you laughed at me when I struggled. I noticed your amazing hair and the faces you made when you pushed all that weight. I stayed up all last night thinking about that. But the most important thing, you took me underneath your wing, and I'll appreciate you for that.

I know this is kind of weird, but I just wanted to ask if you wanted to get dinner sometime. Maybe in a romantic way, maybe not. I don't know if you are into that but something in me just wanted to be with you.

NYU gave me a HORRIBLE aid package, which is why I'm applying for low cost housing, so Founders and University Hall are pretty much out. I'm only looking for Traditional housing, so Third North's out too.

I'm particularly inclined towards Rubin because I want to minimise my costs, but the only problem is that I'm uncertain with whether or not I'll be able to handle 2 roommates. As someone who has an odd sleep schedule and is slightly introverted, how difficult is it to manage studies in shared suites of 3? 

Which dorms offer a valid platform to socialise, barring parties? Which dorms are known for being most diverse, in terms of having the most internationals etc?  I was also wondering if any of the dorms have halal options? 

I realise I'm asking A LOT of questions. I've already gone through NYULocal but would really love specific feedback from current residents. Thanks in advance!",3,1524763946.0,/r/nyu/comments/8f4i5z/help_with_housing_preferences/,None

I’m writing this with intense anxiety, for I’ve applied to NYU Steinhardt for Fall 2018 admission and I’m awaiting a decision. With commitment deadlines quickly approaching for other universities, I was wondering how likely it would be for me to get accepted to NYU. NYU has been my dream school since middle school, so as a third year community college student, this entire application process has been quite nerve-wracking. I just wanted to get honest, unbiased opinions on the likelihood of my acceptance.

- External Transfer from an Out-of-State Community College
- Major: Media, Culture, & Communication
- 3.71 GPA
- 1 solid Letter of Recommendation
   - Written by my college’s Faculty Senate President
- Member of both Phi Theta Kappa & Sigma Chi Eta National Honor Societies 
   - Public Relations Secretary for my local PTK chapter
- Director of Marketing & Communication for a TEDx event
- Open to begin my MCC studies in Paris (I believe this is a new program for MCC transfer students?)
- Why NYU? Award-winning faculty, remarkable global network, MCC is the most ideal program for me (just a quick look at what I wrote about for my Common App)
- So far, I’ve been accepted to University of San Francisco and Marymount Manhattan College. Still awaiting decisions from UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, The New School (Lang), Hunter College, and Brooklyn College

Is there a possibility I’ll get in, or should I pay a commitment deposit to another school I’ve already been accepted to? NYU’s website says transfer applicants won’t hear back until May-June, which is past or cutting it way too close to other schools’ commitment deadlines. Any sort of advice is appreciated!

8egy71,deadeye10003,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/8egy71/experience_with_falling_behind_in_a_course/,Experience with falling behind in a course,"So I've recently been really struggling mentally with depression/feeling down/lack of motivation... I bombed a midterm and skipped class/doing an assignment which turned into missing 3 of 4 classes and falling 4\-5 assignments behind in my writing course. I do not know what to do or how to approach my professor this week after missing both classes last week. The second class in the week before last I told him after that I didn't have the work from that week because I was struggling with some personal things and that I would have it for him next week, which obviously didn't happen. 

I talked with my academic advisor about the situation when I was meeting with her about another issue from another class and she really didn't offer advice that helped me. I also went to walk in counseling at which the counselor strongly advised me to come to walk in psychiatric aid that night to talk about getting something prescribed, but I also found no help in that as all I was prescribed was a sleeping pill that I can't even use because I feel so down during the day and then stay up all night trying to catch up.  But, of course, I never end up accomplishing anything. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and how they ended up resolving the issue with their prof... I'm starting to become worried my prof will give me a terrible grade for the final part of the class/paper we are working on now because  I have missed 3 of the past 4 classes and when I eventually get him the work some of it will be quite late. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",13,1524535442.0,/r/nyu/comments/8egy71/experience_with_falling_behind_in_a_course/,None

8efvis,AzorackSkywalker,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/8efvis/nyu_or_ucla_i_am_an_odd_duck_you_dont_have_to/,"NYU or UCLA (I am an odd duck, you don’t have to tell me)","Ok so I have been accepted to NYU, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, and TU (the university of Tulsa). I have pretty much ruled out TU, UCSB is an unlikely at this point, UCSD was cool but I think I would choose UCLA over it (any thoughts there would be appreciated too). Realistically, I know myself enough to be fairly sure I am either going to UCLA or NYU, but I literally have no idea which one to pick.

I have been admitted undeclared physical science Letters and Science to UCLA and 3/2 physics/EE NYU (but that is highly subject to change). I am interested in chemistry, physics, engineering, and materials science for my main study, but I also would like the opportunity to pursue ancient near east culture and language (specifically Egypt and Achaemenids, but in general would be nice), ASL (in which I am already conversational), comedy, and entertainment (if I am not a scientist or an engineer, I’d probably be a blacksmith, a juggler, or a comedian). (Oh and blacksmithing, woodworking, General making opportunities would be a plus. I have considered that neither city gives me much opportunity for an affordable workshop, but you win some you lose some.) 

I value an extremely diverse range of opportunities and experiences, as is reflected in my diverse range of interests. I would love to join clubs, pole vault (if I can on a not super competitive level, it would be an incredible day if I got 11 feet), be a tour guide or something, maybe join AFROTC, and have a really vibrant social life (because I enjoyed myself in high school, but in a small school in OK, the dating scene is limited, there isn’t a huge variety in friends, and I didn’t really go to parties. I did participate in a fair amount of stuff, but I have long reveled in the opportunity to go somewhere where I am likely average if not below in intelligence so I am not immediately typecast as the smarticle particle, if people even know my name. I am hesitant about the no campus of NYU, but I know and love the city and I am hoping I will figure out how to talk to people spontaneously somewhere along the line. (If it tells you anything I have never asked someone out, I have always been asked out, and about 4/7 times they have spent 2 weeks with me, realized I am actually like this and it isn’t just me trying to be funny, and broke it off).

I legitimately love learning and the quarter system appeals to me because I want to take more classes, but I love the diversity of NYU’s study and the ease with which you can change your major and stuff (and study abroad). I love NYC and have been their often enough that it feels like a second home (my dad is from there), but LA is new and different and I feel like I might have more opportunity to explore the entertainment industry out there if I choose to pursue it. I like Cali weather and I like seasons, I like historical places and novelty, I AM SPLIT AND I CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHERE I AM GOING TO GO. The funniest thing is that I more than anyone I know care so little about the college thing in general, I just want to learn and I don’t give a shit about rankings or D1 sports or even if I am putting myself in a good place for a career, because in my dumb little mind, I cross the career bridge when I get to it. (Hey I would be happy to juggle on the street). 

Finance isn’t a big deal in the decisions, I have some good opportunities on either side to pay for them, and my parents are happy to handle the rest (they might have to wait awhile for the ROI if I become a street juggler, blacksmith, or a comedian though).

I have told you everything I can think of, if you have any questions I will answer, I just need to make a decision. Oh and I didn’t feel at home at either one more than the other, I tried the coin trick and it didn’t work, at this point I’m considering sending a pill out to my school. Please don’t comment if you are just going to tell me to choose one it doesn’t matter, I KNOW BUT I CANT SO HERE I AM.

Since applying, I've decided it would make more sense for me to double major in media, culture and communications and English (because I've decided I want to go into writing/journalism/something communications related instead of education). Ive emailed with some people in undergrad admissions @ NYU and they said changing majors from education to MCC is essentially a matter of filling out a form in the spring of my freshman year because they're both in Steinhardt, but I saw on the MCC transfer undergrad form for current Steinhardt students you have to write an essay about why you want to change and that freaks me out a bit. I want to make sure changing majors is actually possible before I commit to NYU. Can someone who has successfully changed majors/internally transferred (preferably in a similar situation to mine) tell me how difficult it was/if my situation seems possible for me to change? Also, if I should decide to completely internally transfer to CAS (not likely, but i'm asking just in case) would that actually be possible?? I'm stressing out about all of this and NYU is my top choice so I really want it all to work out.

I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this for me. So, for those of you who may be unfamiliar, Writers in Paris is a month long writing/learning program that takes place in...well, Paris. It is required that I live in NYU-provided housing, which is a single-room in, what I assume to be, a dorm. 

Anyways, the crux of my issue is that my girlfriend and I had the idea of her coming with me and staying in my room and hanging around, attending class, etc. The only issue is, however, that she is not a NYU student. Nonetheless, I thought that since it is MY room, which I’m paying for, I can host anyone I please. 

Unfortunately, this is not the case as I have been informed that guests are allowed to stay a maximum of 6 days and cannot attend any lectures or classes. I haven’t a clue as to how the class structures are set up, but I know there will be field-trips and readings and speakers, so I figure she wouldn’t bother anyone but just be a part of the learning. 

So, my question is: has anyone been on a study abroad trip, or, more specifically, Writers in Paris, and can provide information about what it would be like, what to expect, and if there is any way to get around this policy and have her stay with me for the duration of the program? What were your experiences like? Did you ever have trouble having guests with you? 

Any and all opinions and information is helpful! Thank you! ",2,1523894029.0,/r/nyu/comments/8cojzh/cas_writers_in_paris/,None

I need some help with my CORE requirement substitutions. Before I ask my question for help, let me explain my situation—

I am an East Asian Studies undergraduate student at the College of Arts and Sciences and as a result of my major, I am only allowed to take one out of three Cultures & Contexts classes—

* Cultures & Contexts: China
* Cultures & Contexts: Japan
* Cultures & Contexts: Korea

Ultimately, I was able to take none of those requirements over my four-year career. Each time that I tried to register for those courses, they kept being closed with each time the courses were listed on Albert.

I explained this to my major advisor and his aide, and he said that I could substitute one of my other classes for the Cultures & Contexts requirement. I gave him a class and its syllabus for him to look at—he greenlit that substition.

However, this morning in my email, the NYU Graduation Services team stated that my graduation requirements were still incomplete, there being one requirement for me to satisfy.

The sole missing requirement is the Cultures & Contexts CORE requirement.

Now, for my questions—is there a way for me to resolve this? What are the best ways for me to be able to waive the Cultures & Contexts requirement without having to register for another semester? Is there a good way or a bad way to petition Dean Kalb  in order to convince him (or his team) to waive this requirement?

Thank you folks for your help.

What are the chances of transferring into CAS?,"I got accepted into Tandon as a science and tech major with a near full ride (2k per year). It's a great thing and I should be celebrating, but I'm bummed out that I didn't get into CAS, my first choice. I only put down Tandon as my second choice for the heck of it and now I'm regretting it. It's probably my fault for not doing as much research as I should have and assuming that I'll be accepted into CAS, but the more I think about it, the more unsuitable Tandon seems for me. The course selection seems very narrow compared to CAS and I'm really not all that interested in engineering or CS. I almost wish that I had just left the second choice blank and got waitlisted for CAS instead so I could have a chance at it. 

Is Tandon a good school for premed? What is the typical experience at Tandon like, and how does it compare to CAS? Is there anything I can do at this point to try and get into CAS, or will I have to wait to do an internal transfer? How likely are internal transfers from Tandon to CAS?

Honestly, though I am leaning towards TC, and I pretty torn on where to go. On one hand, TC has the prestige of being the oldest and well known graduate school for teacher's, where as NYU places me in a local school district while doing classes online (I get paid to work in the school too, not too well, but still). If I go to TC, I will have to find another job during the year I'm going to school, however, I want to eventually work in a private school (or a public science magnet school like Bronx Highschool of Science) and I feel the Columbia brand name will give me a better shot at it. Honestly through research online, other than reading one statement saying ""almost every teacher in an NYC private school as a TC degree"" I don't have much to back that up, so its just a hunch. Probably due to the ""Ivy League"" brand Columbia has. 

Basically - NYU pays me and gives me a teaching job, though its not my ideal job. However, I feel if I go to Columbia I will have a better shot at getting my ideal job.

I am thinking about transferring to NYU either 2018 spring semester or 2019 fall semester.  
 
I have few questions about CS program at CAS and credit transfer.
Right now I am considering computer science major at CAS as I heard the machine learning and data science is pretty strong in NYU. Coming from your opinion, how is data science and computer science community like in NYU?

For credit transfer, do only science courses with laboratory transfer/fulfill core requirement? Im confused as CAS degree requirement doesnt indicate lab requirement but 'transfer credit guideline' does

i felt i had a very strong application: extracurriculars, grades, essays. however, my sat score was very poor for nyu (i’m in puerto rico. my school can’t surpass 1300 lol) but i submitted anyway knowing my socioeconomic status and ethnicity would come into play.

i hope its understandable that i really... didn’t want to waste away my high school years studying for the sat. especially since i’d rather focus on my extracurriculars; doing this was for the best bc i eventually earned multiple leadership roles throughout my HS career! 

i’d been studying for it since 9th, gone through multiple books and taken courses, but in the end it just felt like a waste of my parent’s money and a capitalistic cashgrab so i was over it. 

so yeah: rejected! but that’s in the past and i’m looking to the future. i’m considering fordham and pace at the moment so i’ll be in nyc either way, but just wanted to see if anyone has had similar experiences to me. i’d love to try for nyu again, someday. either in 1 yr or 4, who knows.

2. Courant has an amazing reputation for research/grad school, but how do undergrads generally tend to do career/grad school admissions wise? I’m unsure exactly what I want to do post-graduation but I’m interested in hearing where exactly recent grads go.

I want to transfer to a engineering school like Tandon whose reputation is on the rise. Tandon's curriculum would let me focus on my major (CS) more with a minor in Math. I've been also told that NYU's notable math department Courant has taken over Tandons Math department which is also another reason. 

Im a freshmen (right now Second term) with a GPA of 3.6, Ik its low but the class that brought me down was Philosophy (B-) trying to fight it. Will most likely be 3.7-3.75 by end of second term because all the classes I'm taking are really interesting and I got everything I wanted.

STATS:
- High school: GPA 3.3 poor but good highschool with AP math/science classes + board of stock market club + math team
- Took some courses in NYU in highschool that first got me into Computer Science (NYU Highschool Career Advancement)

- College:
First Term (Eng, Calc 1, History, Phil, Computer 1 + Lab) 
Overall GPA 3.6 -> Departmental GPA 4.0


Second Term (Texts and Contexts, Calc 2, Computer Science 2+Lab, Discrete Math) -- more major related classes
Overall GPA after second will most definitely be 3.7

- STRONG rec from CS professor + average rec from english professor

- Tutor/Manager at Tutoring company
- Computer Science Tutor @ Fordham
- CS Department Grader for Professor @ Fordham
- Tech Club @ Fordham


Based on these and obviously I will try my best to make my essays appeal to Tandon's misson and NYU's value... What are my chances of getting in because IK NYU has brought their acceptance rate down and is also doing that for Tandon to attract stronger students.

Also, whats the average needed based and grant given for Tandon students. Like what would an average finacial aid package look like.

For background I am a senior in high school with decent stats. So, when I applied to NYU this December, I selected Tandon over CAS because I got scared between the difference of a Bachelors in science and a Bachelors in arts for computer science. I selected this as the only school I would want consideration into. I was extremely excited to go to NYU, mainly because of the social life, the amazing campus, and a new start, but I've recently been reading online debates of Tandon versus CAS and am now regretting my decision. 

I realize I've been imagining a fun future at NYU from the perspective on the main campus, not Tandon. CAS seems like the better respected program, the more social(on the main campus instead of isolated in Brooklyn), and the best program to get connections for jobs and all that - regardless of the bachelor. I take full responsibility for the lack of research, but I'm feeling crushed by the thought of going to Tandon and missing out on all the first year college parties/ friends and regretting it. I know there is internal transfers, but I feel like such an idiot and that I played myself. 

Do y'all have any advice? Maybe don't go to NYU and transfer in second year to CAS, or just tough it through Tandon until I can transfer? Or maybe Tandon isn't all that bad, and if I put in effort to commute I can connect with the main campus? I also realize that online reviews are generally on the extremes of opinion, and I might just be a victim of fear mongering. I'm not sure. 

I also don't want this to come off as conceited, I'm just looking for some honest, brutal advice. Thank you.

Counselor: Form/10 there are too many kids so the counselor uses a form, but she gave me the highest marks possible on the form

Supplemental letter of rec: 10/10 VP of a local finance company worte about how I would be a great fit (I tutor her kid in my non profit) it was very emotional for reasons I won't get into (privacy for them) and made my parents cry, but spoke very highly of me.

I need your help regarding my current manuscript: in it, a character goes to NYU, but I have realized that I have NO idea how life at NYU actually works. 

So, people of Reddit and of NYU, if you have a few moments, would you answer the following questions? If you have any additional information you would like to share, please do so!

Questions:

1. At which times of the year do you have exams?
2. a) What is dorm life like? (Never experienced it myself)
    b) What is life like in a shared apartment off campus?
3. When do you hand in your bachelor thesis?
4. When do you have no university- no classes, no lectures, no deadlines?
5. When does university start again after the summer?
6. Do you have a canteen where all the students eat? (We did in Maastricht, but it was WAY too expensive for the students)
7. Does NYU have official student parties?
8. Can you change universities during your Bachelor/Master, for example from Berkeley to NYU?
9. What is the best part about NYU?
10. What is the worst part about NYU?
11. Any secret places to eat, party, have fun? Cheap cinemas?
12. Do you use your library and if yes, how packed is it every day?

Recently I was admitted to NYU under early decision, and I was excited for all of 5 minutes after reading my acceptance letter and subsequently despondent after reading my financial aid offer. And I know that NYU doesn't have the best reputation regarding financial aid, but I didn't know they would make an offer that's impossible to accept, I thought it more like, it isn't the best place to go if you just look at price. NYU is one of few universities that offer game design, my intended major, and it's really disheartening to have to turn them down. If I could defer my enrollment deadline to give myself time to find scholarships, or defer my enrollment to fall 2019 I'm certain I would but attempting to get anything done through NYU resulted in an hour of wasted time being bounced back and forth between admissions. I was so certain that I wanted to go to this school (I even bought an NYU hoodie), that the slog of high school would finally be worth something come December 15th. But it looks as though my one shortcoming is that Tisch wanted me, but not nearly enough. So it looks as though I'll be writing a letter to the office of financial aid/admissions/whatever, to tell them I'm grateful that they offered me admission, and that they offered me quite a substantial scholarship, but that despite my best effort, if I lived as frugally as I could, it wouldn't be feasible for me to attend unless I was able to get quite a bit of help before the enrollment date.

Next year I'm entering college so I've been gathering as much information as possible regarding feasible college options in the United States and I need your help!!


Anyways, I was scrolling down through some website and it caught my attention the fact that NYU's GPA requirement **tends to be around 3.6 / 3.7** which is exactly what my HS grades translate to (in Chile we use a 1-to-7 grading sytem). What surprised me the most was the fact **they accepted foreign Nationally accredited exams, which includes my country's (PSU)!** Results just became available yesterday and my score got me in the 99 percentile. However, please do consider this percentile is based only on the Language + Math tests scores combined (those two are mandatory and there's other two which are optional). There's also a History test I took in which I scored 775 out of 850 and a Science Test I didn't take.


My family income, however, is really low. Around 31k to 33k a year before taxes from one income source, so I need to know of much of an inconvenient this could potentially be (being able to pay for tuition). I know there's scholarships for International Students but don't know if that income would get me one.

I know I must take an English Language Testing and get a certain score, which I'm almost positive I can achieve. 

So, how low or high are my chances of being admitted to NYU? I'm Chilean, therefore I should qualify as Latino. Still, I see my chances of entering as bleak, which makes this enquiry as a mere consulting. **Thanks in advance for your help and insight**, I'd humbly take any advice regarding this University or any other you might know!!",3,1514370212.0,/r/nyu/comments/7me9ps/chances_of_being_admitted_for_an_international/,None

I've been worried that I might not be competetive enough for admission to the film program. How much of portfolio, ECs and essays considered when a student has a below average GPA? Are classes that are more heavily applicable/relevant to your intended major/program considered more than classes that aren't?  My current *weighted* GPA is about 3.75 to 3.8ish, or about 92 numeric. My concern mainly lies with my unweighted which is closer to a 3.3 or 3.4. By the end of junior year I will've taken 5 honors classes, and 2 APs. I'm captain of our school's varsity academic bowl team, I'm a member of Theatre Troupe, the lead officer of Improv Troupe, I'm a varsity fencer, and I've been cast in 3 extracuriccular school theatre productions. I'm also about to be inducted as an International Thespian. Freshman year I also participated in the Gay-Straight Alliance and Film Club. I'm applying for a study-abroad in Germany this summer and I might be NMS semifinalist, depending on whether or not the cutoff index for my state goes up a point (in which case I'd still be commended scholar) or stays the same, and I got 1350 (740 reading 610 math) on my SAT (which I'm retaking 2 more times)
Demographic-wise: white, Jewish, transgender female. Dad is pretty well-off. (Also worth noting I have a YouTube channel that has garnered close to a million views and I produce comedic animations for it) I really would like to apply but is it worth trying with my low GPA and SAT at the moment? I do not foresee the GPA increasing very much, as I generally struggle with mathematics and math-based sciences; but do pretty well in humanities/language/arts. If anyone has advice on what I could do to help make myself the most marketable admissions candidate or to help compensate for lower GPA, it would be very much appreciated.

I wanted to ask around in different areas and schools such as NYU to see if it has become an issue for Athletes that attend this school. I remembered when I suffered from a concussion years ago and I can tell you it was no joke. In addition, the issue I believe is becoming more serious by the day and is affecting many athletes health. Reason being is due to certain symptoms I have seen many people suffer from after having concussions such as fatigue, signs of depression, and even issues with certain cognitive functions.

So with that being said I wanted to get some feedback and insight from people since I am currently doing academic research on this topic and really think getting some thoughts on this topic would be greatly beneficial. I am definitely open to seeing other people's perspectives on this topic and seeing if there is another way to look at it.

In addition, I am doing also doing a survey that can potentially see if there is a real problem in certain areas of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania pertaining to concussions in sports and also seeing if it can possibly cause certain diseases. So please comment below with your views, which would be greatly appreciated!

Please see link if you would like to do the survey. If you have any questions please let me know!

I want to hear your opinion.

Tuition is about $22k per semester, or $88k for the program. 
My estimate for living in NYC during classes (8 months), while trying to be as cheap as possible, is at $12k/year.

I've heard that there are positions available for on-campus work as Grading Assistant, but the pay is $10-15/h and there is no tuition reduction.
Also, Teaching Assistantships are reserved for PhD students.

So:

- Do you think this investment is worth it? Spending around $110k for this degree.

- Am I missing any assistantship/aid that can help me?

- Should I try to get into other cheaper universities in a future term?

7bbdy7,cjms1996,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/7bbdy7/spring_at_tisch_vs_study_abroad_in_london/,Spring at Tisch vs. Study Abroad in London,"Hey guys! 

I am a student from a different university that has two options for the spring semester, and I wanted the opinions of NYU students. I originally got into a study abroad in London program through my home university. Half of the time you take courses and the other half of the time you take part in an internship. I think it sounds like an amazing opportunity to truly immerse myself in the culture in London and explore Europe (something I have never done before). 

However, I also was accepted to the Spring at Tisch program for Film Production. At my university, I am a journalism and film double major, but I think taking courses at Tisch would be next level. It is an amazing school and could hopefully help me realize whether or not this is what I am meant to do AND hopefully it could help me in the future. 

I am really struggling because London provides a structured program to travel with students my age, engage in a new culture, intern in another country, and to travel in Europe--somewhere I have never been. As for Tisch, it could help me realize whether or not I am meant to pursue film production, help me in the future (yes, this is a direct shoutout to the name and prestige of NYU), and I ultimately want to live in New York (spent the past summer interning in nyc, but I want to move to the city post-grad) and could hopefully help me make some friends and build a community in the city.

If anyone here has insights on what Tisch is like and if it is worth it, that would be so helpful. I feel like I am very split between what my head tells me I should do and what my heart tells me I should do.

Also, if anyone has studied abroad, it would really help to compare and contrast the experience of being an NYU student and a student abroad.

Thanks in advance for the help! It means a lot to me.",2,1510035528.0,/r/nyu/comments/7bbdy7/spring_at_tisch_vs_study_abroad_in_london/,None

I'm not an NYU student but I'm 21 years old and living in north NJ, not too far from the city. I'm interested in meeting other Israeli/Jewish people around my age, and figured Hillel is a good way to do that.

I have two questions that I'd be happy if someone could answer:

 - Are there any events that I can attend without being an NYU student (willing to pay)? And, if so, are any of them ones that I can realistically go alone to (and won't feel left out)?

 - Are there many Israelis or is it almost entirely American Jews? I have a thick Hebrew accent and a very Israeli name, would I feel like a foreigner in NYU's Hillel?

Sorry if this is out of place or against the rules. /r/Hillel is dead so I figured I'd just copy and paste my questions to different schools' subs.

* upper middle class arab-american female, american citizen, but i attend a competitive international school
* plan to apply to NYU's college of arts and sciences with a double major in political science and journalism.

* GPA is currently 3.5, which is the weakest part of my application, but i am hoping to raise it this year. i do have straight As in all of my classes except i messed up in math in 9th and 10th and science in 9th. however, i'm not interested in majoring in anything related to math/science, so is that a very big issue? 
* my school doesn't offer any honor classes, but by the end of high school, i will have completed 5 APs. this year i am in AP Capstone Seminar, AP English Language, and AP Psychology, and in senior year, I'm planning on taking AP English Literature and AP Capstone Research. 
* took ACT once and I got a 28, but I am planning on taking it again

* involved in concert choir, planning on staying involved for all 4 years
* spring plays every year
* volunteer as a director for middle school plays
* peer writing tutor in freshman year
* school ambassador in sophomore year

* Model UN, I've already participated in 3 conferences (my school only lets you participate in 2 per year), and by the time I graduate, I will have completed 7
* member of my school's Global Issues Network club, and every year I attend an international conference, planning on running for vice president this year
* secretary of service club in freshman year
* two week long political science course over the summer, planning on interning with my professor next summer.
* volunteered at hospitals, a women's shelter, Planned Parenthood clinic, local refugee work, and I am volunteering at a Syrian refugee camp in the spring.

* teen columnist at Her Campus
* run a blog where I review books
* recently applied for an internship at another magazine
* writing online stories for all of high school so far, garnering over 100k reads
* almost finished with my first novel, which I am planning on publishing.

sorry this is so long, but i was wondering if my extracurriculars will help them look over the lower grades in math and science, and in general, what my chances are at getting into NYU. thanks!!!

Specifically, I am a trump voter. I don't have the most conventional viewpoints regarding politics, and some of my discussions regarding creating a white ethnostate may have turned a few classmates off. However, I always thought NYU would be an open and welcoming place for discussion and sharing opinions.

Mainly, I want to open up a dialogue to discuss the hatred on campus for those who have different viewpoints and political ideologies.

Just had my visit today and I liked it, though I didn't think the tour was too great (not exactly the tour guides fault but I guess I felt like I didn't see a lot of it since we couldn't go in a dorm room and there weren't students around). But I still think NYU would be my top choice. I just have a few questions and also was wondering if u think I could get in:

GPA: 94.3 W (not given uw or on 4.0 scale, also I can't see my rank
SAT: 1320 (670 RW 650 M, plan on taking it again in October)
AP Tests: Lit (4, took junior year)
I've taken all honors classes up until junior year, the best classes juniors could be in (like trig/analyt instead of trig/precalc)
My schedule for next year (where hopefully I can pick up my gpa just a little bit not that it's bad) is gonna have AP stats, psych, and gov, as well as as an independent study class in Shakespeare, an acting or theatre production class depending on what I got placed in and organic chem.
Extra curriculars: varsity soccer at old school freshman year, jv captain at new (present) school, played volleyball freshman year then sophomore year (Jv), did medical and photography club freshman and sophomore year, also attended Rutgers honors pre-Med program fall sophomore year. Junior year I quit soccer and volleyball cuz I just realized I didn't like them a lot anymore. I did drama club and made the fall play and spring musical, I played varsity tennis, and attended improv club 
Job experience: worked last summer at burger place, working now at American eagle (most likely until I leave for college)
I'm also now involved in a community production of Henry V!

I'm probably gonna apply to either CAS, the liberal studies program or possibly but not likely Gallatin (definitely focused in literature, linguistics, anthropology, psychology (animal psychology) theatre sorta but more so drama)

I haven't written my common app yet, but my nyu personal essay is gonna be more than decent I'm sure.

My questions lie in trying to pick what school (and forming options, if it comes to it) I wanna go into and if any students here could give personal testaments.

Basically, I'm still undecided in picking a field and I don't want to have to pick one! If that makes sense. I think the liberal studies seems nice because I get prereqs out of the way while being able to discover what I want. However, I can do the same thing in CAS, just with more students. So can anyone who's been undecided and either gone through the cas or the liberal studies program tell me how it went and worked out ??

And then when it comes to gallatin, I'm unsure if it's worth it. For one thing, I can always double major, but I realize that that isn't the same thing because you're not tying the two together like you would in gallatin. My tour guide told me how she studied theatre, education, and psychology (I think??) at gallatin and did cool working seeing how different art forms help troubled youth, but I feel like I wouldn't know what I would wanna pick right away! So, are you able to transfer into gallatin after a year or two or whatever from the cas, or after you graduate the liberal studies program? And what schools can U go into after the liberal studies program?

Sorry I know I threw a lot of stuff onto this post! I appreciate if you read it all but you don't really have to just any question u can answer I'd appreciate it... also lastly I have heard nyu isn't very generous with aid. My parents make collectively 150,000 ish, and the year I enter college I would be 1/3 siblings in college. And well my academic record is above so anyone with similar scores to me can you tell me how much money you received ?

so i was wondering if any transfers (hopefully into Tisch film/tv but anything helps) could talk about the transfer process and their experiences with tisch/nyu as a whole. the website looks great and all but ive been hurt before, you know what i mean?

some things i really wanna know about:

-what is the overall student culture of tisch/nyu?

-do yall actually have traditions or is it just something they say?

-do people in tisch/nyu actually care about being there?/are they passionate about what they're doing?

-do you feel that the administration/faculty/staff are supportive of the students? or are they basically using you just for the paycheck?

-in tisch specifically, are people more likely to help you out with a project or watch you drown? 

-for the film/tv admissions portfolio, what are they looking for? 

-how much does tisch prepare you for a real film/tv career?

-does ur tuition raise 3.5% every year/is nyu good about giving financial aid to people like me who desperately need it

im actually literally dreading going back 2 school and i never thought i'd feel like that pls help i need a better future

Not being able to explore nature is my one issue with NYU as I head there this fall as a freshman. I tried to search for a nature / hiking club through NYU, and was really expecting to find one, and was very letdown to see that there was nothing of the kind. I understand that it would be extremely difficult to run such a club, but I was thinking that there must be many other students who feel the same way, no? That if there were enough students who wanted one, there would certainly be a club for it.

Does anyone know of one? I'd be extremely interested in joining it if so. I know that there is Central Park in Manhattan, and Prospect Park in Brooklyn, but every semester or a similar timeframe, it'd be incredible to escape the city for a day.

The main things that are attractive about Tandon to me are as follows:
a) The i^2e concept, in that it seems as though the classes are designed to help you thrive in a innovative field as opposed to working behind a desk doing the same design work your whole career
b) The location is very nice. The whole environment in Brooklyn right now seems to be very inviting for tech start-ups (which is where I want to find myself after school) and the connections that can be made through the school are seemingly invaluable 
c) It is an opportunity to get away from the ""machine"" that is most engineering schools here in the Midwest

HOWEVER, I'm turned away for equally important reasons, which are as follows:
a) In high school (I'm currently a senior) I am a pretty normal if not ""popular"" kid. I drink, party, have a big group of friends, etc. I'm worried that I won't be able to find other students who aren't so nerdy, and from a lot of posts it seems like the majority of kids are playing video games when they're not in class

1. As a transfer, do I have any chance of getting on-campus housing? Is the housing application first come first serve, i.e. should I sign up as soon as possible or is it randomly selected?

2. If I cannot get on campus housing, what is the best way to find other NYU students to look for housing together (FB groups etc.)?

3. If you had to choose between NYU for CS/Econ and USC for a similar program (CS/BA), which would you choose and why?

I don't attend NYU, but I'll be staying in their dorms this summer as I'll be interning in New York.

Which dorm is great for socializing?

Are there any dorms with wifi issues?
Which dorms do you wish you lived in your first year? Why?
Is there a special dorm for music oriented people and meeting them? (Weinstein - because of the music rooms?)
Which dorms are the cleanest?

I understand that these are all pretty subjective and generally bad questions but most the articles, comments, and videos haven't really helped me with this.

I've heard weinstein is a great dorm however the rooms are really small and prison like...
Lipton seems great however I don't want to be in a dorm where there's a party every hour of the day, although is it really like that and what other dorms are that alive?
Brittany and Rubin seem pretty outdated and a bit dirty- what would their pros be?

61aooo,iamnotyourdude,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/61aooo/tandon_doesnt_actually_suck_especially_now/,Tandon doesn't actually suck - especially now,"Hey guys, so I'm currently a freshman at NYU Tandon studying CS, and I feel the need to clear things up because everyone enjoys shitting on Tandon (myself included), but people don't seem to realize that Tandon isn't actually bad. So I'll just talk about some of my experiences and my knowledge as a student at NYU's SoE for people that are asking about it.

**1. TANDON DOESN'T SUCK THAT BAD**

Firstly, a lot of people's misconceptions about Tandon come from the times leading up/during its merger with NYU. During this time, everything was a mess and Tandon (then Poly) wasn't really taken care of well. It didn't really fit with the rest of NYU considering it had its own rich history. Trying to merge these two schools was not perfect, and so Tandon kind of looks like the shitty NYU school that got tacked on.

Tandon was its own school before that had a name. It's the second oldest private engineering school (RPI the first) and it produced many notable people. It had its own thing going on for quite a while, it just wasn't a part of NYU and, honestly, didn't quite fit in well.

Secondly, Brooklyn is not Queens or Harlem or the Bronx. And what I mean by that is Brooklyn is NOT that far. People seem to think Brooklyn is extremely far for some reason and whenever I'm on main campus (every day), people say ""Wow, you came all the way from Brooklyn??"" It's a 20 minute subway ride or a 15 minute shuttle ride, and when I tell people this they always say, ""Oh that's it? That's actually not bad"".

On a related note, Brooklyn is definitely physically removed from Manhattan. I don't want to make it sound like you're just gonna be walking over to Bobst when you want. It's obviously not the same as having your school on the main campus. You're not going to be walking to each other's dorms and be in Manhattan the same amount of time. There is definitely something different. But, this leads to the misconception that the school is completely removed both physically and emotionally from the main campus. A few of my friends from Tandon and I are some of the most active (if not the most active) members of a big club based in main campus. Most of my friends are on main campus. I go to main campus every day to study at Bobst via the shuttle and I visit friends all the time. Going to NYU's Brooklyn campus is not like going to NYU's Abu Dhabi campus...

NYU Tandon is not some breeding ground for socially awkward or freakish nerds. All my friends and I are very normal (or as normal as college students are). I mean, there are quirky kids here, and by all means, if you're that kind of person, you'll fit in. Everyone I hang out with is incredibly normal and social, and most of the people I see are. There are many people that are ""more interesting"", and feel free to come join them.

Next, people always comment on how few girls there are at Tandon because it's an engineering school.  
Yeah, tbh that's pretty true lmao. Sorry you're just gonna have to deal with that one. You can still meet a lot of people outside of Brooklyn though, if that really bothers you.

**2. TANDON MIGHT ACTUALLY BE PRETTY GOOD**

Basically I've just been explaining why Tandon doesn't suck, but now I'll talk about what you might enjoy/benefits of Tandon.

A Bachelor of Science degree vs a Bachelor of Arts degree. While this isn't a revolutionary difference, a BS can definitely look better at times. Tandon offers a BS while the College of Arts and Sciences offers a BA. This can be a difference in why you'd choose Tandon CS over CAS's CS program. In fact, I've heard (but am not entirely positive if true), that it's pretty hard for CAS CS majors to transfer to Tandon for CS because of all the things that Tandon does differently for that sexy Bachelor of Science. This includes the many science/engineering focused classes that are focused on here as opposed to the liberal arts electives at CAS.

If you go to an engineering school, you will be surrounded by engineers. Being around like-minded individuals that share a similar passion can be a very nice experience. Everyone you're around appreciates STEM and has something to share with you. Being in school with all STEM students really promotes a very positive type of thinking and imagination. There's also so many people to help you with whatever you need, whether it be homework, studying, or actual professional advice.

Tandon also offers a sense of community that I appreciate. I don't know how it is at the other schools (because I obviously go to Tandon), but I feel like Tandon is pretty tightly knit. Most people know each other in my year. I think that the shared experience of struggling at an engineering school and the isolated school make for a nice community. But like I said, maybe other schools are like that too?

The MakerSpace is pretty cool(?)

Tandon is getting a shit ton of attention and donations because it's new. A new building is being built across the street and people are pretty excited for it. Everything is constantly getting more funding and attention.

Kind of related to my last point, Tandon is still a baby to NYU. While the school itself had history when it was independent, to the eyes of NYU it's still very new. Because of that, the school's been improving like crazy. Some of the courses seem to have gotten more difficult and NYU seems to be putting high standards on Tandon in hopes of seeing its rise (which it has already been doing). For instance, Tandon's acceptance rate has gone from about 70% to 35% in the span of a year (I believe? I might need to check that again to be positive). People recognize the significance of STEM and engineering schools, at seems that NYU is jumping on the bandwagon.

Tandon, given its long-ass history as an engineering school, has some pretty notable alumni, probably some of the most notable of NYU, excluding Tisch (wya Childish Gambino?). I don't know if this will do much for you except give you bragging rights and help you cope at night for how expensive your tuition is.

But you know what?

**3. MAYBE TANDON DOES SUCK(?)**

This has some general comments as well as some specifically for people that are deciding whether they should commit to NYU Tandon.

Tandon is not Stern. And Tandon doesn't have any very notable majors/programs. But at the same time, it's an engineering school. And like I said, NYU seems to really be hoping for a lot from Tandon in the future. As a result, if you go to Tandon you're going to be putting in a lot of work for not much recognition. Everyone shits on Tandon, including my friends and me, because it's extremely funny. But there is some truth in the jokes about how very few people view the school in a positive light. Because it's so new and the merger wasn't phenomenal, people view Tandon in a funny way. People that actually learn about Tandon generally have much more respect for it, but that's definitely not the majority of people.

Like most engineering schools, Tandon is pretty fucking hard. The courses are pretty rigorous and tend to go at an accelerated pace compared to their counterparts in the other schools. The workload is also fucking stupid and everyone I know from main campus is shocked at how much work we have to put up with.

Tandon is not well polished. I don't know if ""Poly"" has always been like this or if this is a result of a messy transition, but there are definitely things that I just pick up on that make me say, ""Really?"". I don't know how else to put it, but if you come here, you'll know what I mean.

Did I already mention that there are like no girls? That sucks for both guys and girls. I mean, the ratio is slowly starting to even itself out as people want an equal representation of gender in the STEM field, and girls seem to be showing more interest in the sciences. But still, it's pretty rough as of now.

I already said that it's very easy to be involved on the main campus, but you're still living in Brooklyn. The area itself can be pretty nice and quiet/cozy. But it's definitely not as exciting and loud as Manhattan. And you're still technically removed from the other students of the main campus. If you want to be a part of main campus life, you'll actually have to try.

**SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS**

Tandon has its strengths and weaknesses, like any other school. I personally like it here, but it might not be for everyone.  
tbh just go to MIT.

I've been accepted to the class of '21, and I was looking at my major requirements to sort of get an idea of what to expect in the fall. I was wondering:

1) When do freshmen register for classes? I heard it's in august, but do we register like, the week before classes begin? 

2) As a Steinhardt student, apparently I'm required to take a course called New Student Seminar. The website says it's a noncredit pass/fail course; does this mean this class won't affect my grades unless I fail? If so, do people kind of slack off in these things since you just have to pass? Also, when registering for classes, since this is a noncredit course, will I be registering for 16+ credits in addition to the new student seminar? Does this mean this course doesn't really involve a heavy workload? Because I was hoping to graduate earlier, I was planning on taking 18 credits per semester, and if I have to do that as well as the seminar, I wanted to know what I'm getting myself into.

Sorry for the long questions! I just couldn't find a lot of information regarding these topics online, and I'm an international student as well as a first generation college student-to-be, so I was unsure where to ask.

So I'm pretty interested in the joint CS/Economics major but I see on their website that the type of Econ would have to be a theory, rather than policy concentration if I wanted to joint major Econ and CS. 
Do you guys think it would be possible to ask an advisor or someone in the department for permission to switch to the policy track if I get accepted?

5y9oat,Somec00ldude,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/5y9oat/advice_and_chances_of_acceptance/,Advice and Chances of Acceptance,"Hello, I'm a junior in Florida, and it would be nice if I could hear opinions on my chances of getting into NYU.

New SAT: 1430 (750 reading and 680 math); I've only taken it once and that was without studying, so I intend to study more and score in the 1500s next time.

Unweighted GPA: 3.58 (hopefully will get it up to 3.6 something with next semester or Summer courses)
Weighted GPA: 4.1
Class Rank: 57/420-430 (something in that area, which admittedly is not impressive for my school, but at least it's top 15%, which is probably not that impressive either)

I am in the International Baccalaureate program, a well-recognized program that provides students with the rigor of college level courses, so essentially like AP, but as an entire program and schedule, and probably more effective (not to disregard the effectiveness of AP courses, some IB courses do follow the AP curriculum for junior year). I have taken some AP exams, though. I received a 4 in psychology, a 5 in statistics, and I am hoping to secure a 4 or 5 in the BC calculus exam in May. We do have our own IB exams at the end of senior year to determine college credit received for courses taken, but of course this is already after college applications are either accepted or rejected. I am currently finishing up an online course for introduction to computer science in python provided by MITx on the Edx website which will hopefully result in a certificate that actually has gravity given the provider of it. I will also hopefully be interning at the beginning of senior year with my friend's dad, who owns his own IT company, so that should add some depth to my résumé given I am pursuing a degree involving software and computer science. I might also pursue some sort of Summer internship, though I am not sure where or for what at the moment. I am just looking for something that will give me professional experience, even if it is not related to my desired major, like an internship at a law office. I currently work at Publix, and though I do get practice with my social skills, I feel that a more professional environment would be good for me. I have heard of students emailing professors at nearby colleges and securing Summer research roles, which also offers nice experiences and pads the résumé quite a bit.

I was born and raised in Florida, but my entire immediate and extended family is from Brazil. I do not speak it too well, but I understand most conversations in Portuguese. I am not sure if nationality will have any impact on my status as an applicant given I do not identify with the culture.

As far as clubs and extra-curriculars, I participate in the following: Ted-ed Club Historian (you know, those online videos with thought-provoking discussions), French Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta (math club), Science Honor Society, National Honor Society, Pre-medicine Club, Student Council Vice President in Sophomore Year (all we did was set up Hoco), occasional ultimate frisbee member (would like to go more frequently and participate in next tournament), sound technician for a school play last year, volunteer at elderly home once a week (nothing significant, mostly just help with meals, which makes me feel like I should do something else with a greater impact). I do intend to join Spanish Honor next year and hopefully secure a position in one or two of the honor societies I am already in and maybe organize some significant event for the club.

As the IB program is very accelerated, I believe that I am already semi-fluent in French and will probably actually be fluent by the time I leave high school. My sister took IB French at a different school and maxed out her French credits for college, being forced to take business French. As I previously stated, I understand Portuguese, but do not speak it very well, though I could try to relearn over the Summer as they appear to just be dormant lingual skills I have not used in a long time. I thought I should add this section in to see thoughts on bilingual and trilingual skills having an impact on desirability as an applicant.

I would like to apply early decision for some sort of computer science degree, as the New York area is my dream location, and New York University seems to possess a multitude of positive qualities. I do find my GPA worrisome, but I also hope that the recognition of my rigorous program will make up for it. I am honestly not trying to sound egotistical when I say that IB is nationally recognized. I am just not sure how much it counts for along with the rest of my résumé. Even if I do get accepted, I feel like I might not be able to go due to financial reasons, as in I have literally no money for college. I have no college savings whatsoever. I could probably go to University of South Florida with a full scholarship, but I truly have my sights set on New York. I would have to take out tens of thousands in student loans, and see what I could do about financial aid, which is comparatively low for NYU compared to other schools. What are your thoughts on the possibility of a huge grant? Is it likely? I will probably also go through numerous websites applying for third party scholarships worth a few thousand here and there.

Other details: my relationship with all of my teachers is not very good. They do not dislike me, but they do dislike my work ethic, which I admit is very lazy to the point of doing practically no work. The only reason I have semester grades of A's and B's is because I allow my intelligence to carry me rather than putting in concrete work. This probably paints me in a bad light, but I want to be honest, as I do intend to improve this next grading period and beginning of senior year, as all of my teachers know I'm intelligent but just lack motivation. I also wanted to address the college essay, which I believe I can write fairly well. I have been told I'm pretty eloquent in my speech and writing, and I would like to think I have a charm in my written and interviewing skills in terms of social situations(I can't write an English paper or timed essay to save my life). I just wanted to understand the type of tone I should take and what exactly I should emphasize outside of the generic 'well-rounded, be yourself' advice.

Overall, I applaud whoever had the heart to read through this short essay of inquiries I have written. Please respond with your thoughts of my desirability as an applicant, chances of me being accepted when I apply in November, and any advice you can offer. Thank you very much.

I am a Law student from eastern europe, and I was always dreaming of studying in NYC. Now I've decided to take one year break during the course of my studies (I am currently on 3rd year of undergraduate studies) and to apply as a visiting student to NYU for next academic year. 

I have a lot of academic achievements which I am quite happy about (Rector's Scholarship for the best students - 2 years in a row, presented papers in national & international law conferences including World Congress for Philosophy of Law in Washington DC 2 years ago, won nation-wide scientific competitions, different internships etc.) but unfortunately this year I've failed my first course (Administrative Court Proceedings, real nightmare but unfortunately one of the biggest courses) and because of that my GPA dropped to around 2.99. Also, I am worried because in application form there is no place for any kind of personal statement, they just want my GPA and academic transcript. In my situation it's not good because that way I can't tell anything about my other achievements.

I'm a Junior in High School looking to study computer science in college, and NYU is one of my top choices at the moment. 

That being said, I'm sort of confused about the difference between Tandon and CAS. I have read some posts on /r/NYU and I understand the basics, but I'm still not sure what is right for me from a career point of view. 

So I have a few questions:

1: Would one degree prepare me for a career in software engineering/development more than the other? (SE is what I think I want to do)

2: Math is not my strongest area, is the addition of Calculus 2 and Data Analysis in Tandon a significant increase in difficulty over just Calculus 1 and Descrete Mathmatics in CAS?

3: Will a future employer care if I have a BS over a BA? Or will the fact that CAS is critically acclaimed by many make up for that fact?

4: I plan on going on a tour of NYU in the next month or two, assuming I decide that Tandon is better for me to apply to, do I want to do the Tandon specific tour/info session, or should I get the tour of main campus first? 

5: Finally, more of an opinion question. I've heard people say that Tandon as a campus isn't as nice as the main NYU campus. Is this true? Is it bad enough to be part of the decision process between Tandon and CAS?

I'm really sorry if I missed any posts outlining these questions already. Thanks for the help! ",5,1487632158.0,/r/nyu/comments/5v7wi8/tandon_computer_science_vs_cas_computer_science/,None

However, I've recently come to realize that the dynamic of art school and a career in the arts is just not for a person with my more passive, shy personality. On top of that I don't particularly enjoy putting my personal thoughts and opinions out for the world to see without some level of anonymity. It's just something I've always been uncomfortable with. 

Art for me is a personal escape, something for enjoyment and exploration of my own beliefs and emotions. Having to do it as an obligation kind of ruins it for me. So with these thoughts in mind I'm deciding to choose the more ""standard"" route. I've always been fairly interested in and good at chemistry and biology in high school so I want to transfer to CAS and hopefully follow a pre med path. 

How difficult are internal transfers from Tisch to CAS pre-med? I don't hear of many people doing it since I guess Tisch is the more exclusive school. In general, I could really use some second, third, forth opinions on this topic. Am I wrong to think that a more quiet, emotionally reserved individual probably won't do well in film or animation.

* Realistically, how expensive is NYU in comparison to similar institutions? Many private schools seem to be in the same tuition ranges

5cijpb,Alan_Kathleen,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/5cijpb/tandon_computer_science_vs_cascourant_computer/,Tandon Computer Science vs CAS/Courant Computer Science,"Hi, I am a junior at Tandon, studying Computer Science. I think I've seen a million posts where people ask what's the difference, so I'm going to, in detail, describe the Tandon CS curriculum and department to the best of my ability. Obviously, I will only comment on the undergrad level, since I have no experience with anything beyond that. My hope is that someone will post a mirror comment in this thread with the details of CAS CS so that people can see everything side by side. I've never taken a CS class at CAS so if I mention CAS stuff, it's just going to be general public info. Also, *this is not a school/campus comparison*, there's already a ton of those, this is just comparing the major/program. Anyways, here's the down-low.

**On the surface**:

Tandon offers a Bachelor of Science, CAS offers a Bachelor of Arts. You should do your own research and see if this matters to you and if so, which one you want.

**Requirements**
http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-bs/tandon-cas-cs-programs

Details in the link, but a brief summary:
Tandon has almost twice as many required CS cores.
Tandon has twice as many math requirements.
Tandon and CAS basically have the same required number of CS electives.
Same general science requirement(ish).
Same expos requirement.
CAS requires foreign language, Tandon doesn't.
Tandon has EG (I'll get to that below).
Different focuses for minors.

**Nitty Gritty**

**Expos**

I have heard from someone who took both that CAS expos is easier than Tandon expos, but you might want to  ask around. In general, Tandon expos is notorious among freshmen for being the hardest of the first-year courses, but that could just be because everyone going into the school is strong in science/math, not writing, whereas CAS being more geared towards liberal arts that might not be as much of an issue. But again, ask around.

**Math**

Personal opinion on the math department: It's great. I like programming but I suck at math. Like I'm just shit at it. However, despite the fact that I dreaded it in HS, I loved it here. Seriously, a lot of the math professors are great. Unfortunately, it ain't all sunshine and roses though. Discrete at Tandon sucks, full stop. In the time I've been here, it's cycled between 3 different professors. Don't know a thing about the last one, but the first two had a very bad rep among students for not explaining concepts well at all and having a broken curriculum. This course is also managed by the CS dept for some reason. In general, most people here do not like Discrete. Data Analysis is similar. It's managed by the Math dept however. Opinions vary on data. Some say it's okay, other people will say its as hard as discrete. Decent professors teach it though. For CS, that's about the jist of math. If you want to go into the Game Engineering minor, you may be inclined to take Lin Alg & Diff Equations (You can't take Lin Alg without Diff Equations), which shouldn't be a problem. I'd say it's about at the same difficulty as Calc 2.

**Science**

Fairly standard stuff. You requirements are you need 3 sciences, Chem, Physics, or Bio. You can take any combination (Bio1, Phys 1, Phys 2 for example). The issue with this is that no matter what combination you choose, you will inevitably be stuck with at least 1 upper level lab course (upper level is an arbitrary distinction I'm making between something like the Phys 2 lab and the Chem 1 lab, which aren't anywhere in the same ball park of difficulty). Performing the labs aren't the difficult part, the lab reports are what you should be worried about. For Phys 2 lab, writing reports could run you anywhere between 5-15 hours depending on the lab/professor. Bio I hear is not much better. I know next to nothing about upper level chem labs though.

**EG**

General Engineering courses everyone in the school, save for Integrated Digital Media majors, need to take. Opinions vary, I personally think it is kind of a waste of time. Can be kind of useful to build presentation skills and what not, but besides that, I don't see much point. You basically work in groups to build NXT robot lego things over a semester and give a presentation every week on a lab you perform. That's 1003. EG1001 is nothing, it's basically an entirely attendance based course.

**Humanities**

Not much to say about these. Fairly standard courses as far as I can tell. Can find many odd-ball courses appear for a semester and then never again. Usually a somewhat interesting selection offered every selection.

**Minors & Electives**

For CS, We have Cyber-Security and Game Engineering as minors. Everyone in the Integrated Digital Media building is pretty into games, they constantly have game events and people showing off their personal projects and such and receiving feedback. Very big community for this stuff. The courses required for Game Engineering are pretty cool. I think the course descriptions for most of them are fairly self explanatory. Most seem to be project, not test based (a good thing imo). I don't know much about cyber-security, but there is certainly a scene for it here. There's an event called CSAW run by a few students here at the cyber-security lab.They also occasionally go to competitions and stuff for that sort of thing. Don't know much about the cyber-sec courses though.

**Big Picture**

It shouldn't matter, but in case you're wondering, the curriculum here does Python --> C++ --> C and decent chunk of assembly sprinkled around Sophmore/Junior courses. Many CS courses give you the option to work in groups, which, assuming you have a reliable group, can lighten the load on homework. Is it difficult here? I think it's ridiculously hard. A lot of studying. A lot. Do I recommend it? I think it's pretty ok/good. The faculty for the CS dept is pretty solid. Very diverse list of electives to choose from usually. Go do some research and read the comments where (hopefully) people posted helpful info on CAS CS and decide for yourself. Good luck.

So for myself, I'm confused about left and right hand, like my instructor told me to move my right hand's third finger, so I took a few seconds to think, because I am not good at this. But then my instructor was asking me ""Were you sleeping?"". And one time I just want to clarify something we learned from the first day of class, he replied ""We've been talking this for so long."" 
Should I do something in this case? Or I'm just too sensitive and should not worry about it?

57k2sp,tandon_throw_away,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/57k2sp/_/,:(,"Someone already made a rant about Tandon (the rude one about Indians), but I want to vent out too. There isn't anywhere or anyone where I can express all my frustration to. I can't say it the Facebook group, I can't tell my friends at Tandon because I don't want to shit on the school they go to. I can't tell me friends outside of Tandon because I'm living a big lie. The big lie that I go to NYU. I don't go to NYU. I go to tandon. These are TWO DIFFERENT colleges. Tandon is still that no-name Polytech School with the word NYU in front of it. I went to a Specialized HS, and Tandon feels like a community college. There is no actual learning happening in the undergrad courses. Im majoring in CS and finished one year and I can fully say that Tandon is a horrible school. I'm sorry that I sound like such an asshole. I'm sorry my grammar is atrocious. I'm just depressed. I'm depressed because I went to one of the best high schools in NYC. People use to always tell me ""Wow you went to that HS? You are smart!"" I dont have anything much going for me. I'm fat, nonsocial, not good at any sports, have an atrocious appearance, extremely inexperienced, and other things. The only thing I had was me being smart. I went to a top tier High School and had classes with some of the smartest of our generation. I actually had something that made me proud. It unfortunetly made me too proud. I had a huge ego and didn't study as much as I should've at highschool. I wasted 4 years playing videogames and watching anime. I didn't even use the free time to develop a social life. When applying to colleges I only applied to colleges here at NYC, since my family wanted me to stay with them. My dream school was Columbia, but yes you guessed it, I got rejected. I know I shouldn't feel bad. It is totally my fault. I didn't work hard enough. There are thousands of kids who got rejected and they deserved to go to a much more prestigious school than me. And I know that. But it still feels bad, you know? I was crushed. But then I got an email from NYU, saying that I got accepted. I was filled with joy. I told my parents and they were so happy for me. I was like, hey maybe I don't suck after all :'). The next morning I was telling my classmates of how I got into NYU. When they told me which school? I told them the school of engineering. .... They laughed. Told me to look up online and there in google. I saw it. 75% acceptance rate. I know, I know its for 2013. The year before it got merged with NYU. Its probably higher now, but not by much. Slapping a Name of a prestigious uni on a school wont magically cut down the acceptance rate by half. I know that, since most kids from my HS who were going to Tandon are the kind of kids who skipped 90% of their classes and barely gave a shit. I didn't skip any of my classes, and all though I wasted a large amount of my time playing video games and watching anime I was able to pull off a decent GPA (higher than 3.0) and a decent SAT score (higher than 2100). lol I like such a conceited asshole right now. I'm sorry. It just frustrated me so much during the time. I applied to NYU and whenver other people ask me which college I was going to, I say ""NYU"". A smile appears in their face and they congratulate me on going to such a good university. I always feel ashamed whenever I tell people I go to NYU. Tandon really doesn't match up with NYU's standards. First year went by, (again I'm such a conceited asshole) and most of the kids here are dumb ass rocks. First year finished by and I pulled off a near perfect 4.0 GPA without any issues. But most kids here struggled. It is not because the courseload here is high. It REALLY isn't. Its just most of these kids just can't take the blame for being lazy af and just blame the school for not teach properly. I know some kids who always shit on their professors for not teaching well but I always see them playing DOTA/hearthstone on their devices and not giving a shit. First year went by and I did not learn SHIT. As a side note (again I am going to sound like an asshole, sorry for repeating this) most of these kids wear a NYU sweatshirt. Its fine and all, but nobody wears a Tandon shirt??? I see kids in the main campus proudly wearing apparel with the name of their NYU School (Tisch, Stern, CAS, Steinhardt, etc). But nobody wears a Polytechnic or a Tandon shirt here? Also in their FB profile most NYU kids specify which NYU school they go to, but 80% of tandon kids just say they go to NYU. Its like they know Tandon is not really a recognized school. But at the same time these assholes are always saying how Tandon is the hardest school in NYU. Like bitch please, I'm taking a class a Main Campus atm and that class is 10x more rigirous than all my other classes here at Tandon combined. Its really sad tbh. I hate it when Tandon kids joke about the rest of NYU (like seriously??? wth Tandon is literally a dingleberry of NYU). Like bruh I know the topics they teach here at the engineering school are hard but the professors dumb it down so hard for us its not even funny. Like for Physics, they would give us 10 multiple choice Regents Level questions for the midterm. The midterm is 100 minutes long -_-. And quite a few kids still manage to fail these exams, like they are actually trying to tank their GPA. I have a friend who is taking Calculus at LaGuardia community college and his Homework problems were actually more rigirous than the ones at Tandon (I'm deadass not making this up), but I never tell him. He respects me for going to NYU and I'm too scared of telling him the truth. What sucks is that I major in CS at tandon but there is a better CS program at CAS (I should've done my fucking research when applying to colleges). I have to cover up me going to tandon, and just tell ppl I study CS at NYU. I dont have anyone to tell all this frustration in me to tell, because I'm embarrased, ashamed, and don't really have anyone to talk too about this. I want to transfer to another college but the only thing I have right now is a high GPA and nothing else. My HS grades, SAT scores, and extracurriculars aren't stellar. I'm not stellar. I was never stellar. In HS I had something, but then I blew it. Now I'm back to zero at this shitty ass community college. I guess it was never meant to be ;(. Sorry I had to write this essay long rant. I just really needed to express how I feel and the only place I could talk about it without any obvious regrets is here at the ghost town known as the NYU subreddit.

It was for a $15/hour job but it would have been a great opportunity to work in a start-up sort of environment and put CRM on my resume. 

I left NYU 5 years ago, failed to intern because I had to make up courses or focused on summer courses, and now, I am struggling temping. 

Folks, don't make my mistakes. There is not a day I am not shocked how stupid this all is. But these are skills I will need to get a 12/hour job as a receptionist in a company where maybe--*maybe*--there might be more room for me someday as a full-time, salaried employee. 

TAKE THESE. If CAS or whatever college you are enrolled in offers them, I suppose I would take those too. They're offered maybe once per semester (falls/spring). http://www.stern.nyu.edu/portal-partners/academic-affairs-advising/policies-procedures/resources

Check for ""nyu bootcamps and workshops"" regularly. It's a basic for all office work right now. 

I always assume you guys are less stupid than I was because NYU and the city labor market were different, but really--this is a grace period and you have a very small window of time to get at least 2 internships related to your field under your belts and learn how to function in your desired future work setting. 

You are allowed to list skills workshops like Dan Gode's on your resume. He charged $325 for a financial modeling in excel course to continuing ed students--you get that *free*. (Unfortunately, the bootcamp for fall is past). 

Liberal arts, pre-law--just take them, because all of these stupid programs are precursors to the specific software or database your future office will expect you to know. 

I actually had a recruiter for a temp agency tell me they won't help people that ""need to be trained"" and don't have these on their resume (v-lookup, pivot tables, charting). 

If you can find an NYU class that teaches those things with a professor that is a fair grader and teaches difficult material clearly, with lots of opportunities to raise your grade (e.g., frequent small quizzes), I would take them because it's costlier and so much harder to learn later on, without multiple sessions and homework with a professor.

52thu5,ianfightme,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/52thu5/usnews_ranking_nyu_dropped_from_32_to_36/,USNEWS ranking NYU dropped from #32 to #36,"Why NYU fell behind urochester and brandeis, and GIT.

Here is the difference in college ranking(not graduate):


Business program 5 -> 5


-Accounting 9-> 9


-Marketing 3-> 3


-Finance 2-> 2


-Insurance 8 -> 9


-International 2-> 2


-Management 6 -> 9


-Management Info System 10 -> 11


-Quant Analysis 7 -> 8


-Real Estate 6 -> 6


Best college for Vets  26 -> 22


HS counselor ranking 22 -> 23


Innovative schools 21 -> 13


Engineering n/a - > 63 

I checked brandeis and rochester and the only variable that makes them better is best value which tbh NYU is going to have a crap rank. (GIT is difficult to compare due to many differences)

But then why did NYU drop after several years of maintaining a #32?

As you can see in college rankings, Stern didn't shift in its business program and its subprograms barely shifted at all. The other rankings are higher than NYU's overall ranking except for that one variable, the undergraduate engineering school. 

If you look at last year, the engineering school was not accounted for and Stern's ranking likely balanced out the shitty best value ranking keeping NYU at 32.


 Now you factor in a engineering school that ranks at #63 tieing with 11 other schools including SUNYs before dropping to #75 and factor in another drop in average GPA and SAT scores. It's plain as day why NYU's ranking dropped to shit. Don't get me wrong, urochester and brandeis both have shitty engineering schools too but at least they're ""best value"" schools.

Conclusion: Stern still rules, the rest of NYU is still the same. NYU sucks at engineering (or its only as good as a state school).",0,1473897224.0,/r/nyu/comments/52thu5/usnews_ranking_nyu_dropped_from_32_to_36/,None

I've met and subsequently fallen in with a nice group of friends, but for the most part these friends resemble ""high school me""- in that they seemingly have no desire to drink, party, or otherwise meet other people.

I know that when I decided to come to NYU I was signing up for a less party-centric experience, and I'm ok with that. What I'm less ok with is another 4 years of standing on the social sidelines, not understanding how everyone else is managing to get drunk/laid.

I wanted to use college as an opportunity to step outside my comfort zone, to decide what I want for myself rather than have others decide for me. However, after one week I'm still well inside my comfort zone, feeling myself falling into old habits and once again being relegated to the sidelines.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice (regarding getting ""out there"" socially at NYU), or could otherwise sooth my anxieties. In particular, I was hoping to find someone who like me came to NYU having never participated in the typical teenage rituals, but learned to find a balance between their introverted nature and some extroverted fun.

Just letting you know that applications are open for 2016-2017 Engineering and Commerce Case Competition (EngComm). 

This competition pits teams of 4 students from universities around the world in a  gruelling weeklong competition. Participants from the business and engineering faculties will work together on 3 cases (2x6 hours, 1x12 hours) and present their findings to a panel of judges. The best scoring teams after the 3 cases will present the last case one more time to the EngComm board of directors for selection of the winners. 

The competition is hosted by Concordia University in beautiful Montreal, Canada, from February 28th to March 4th 2017. You’ll be staying at a world class hotel in the heart of downtown Montreal close to all the bars and restaurants to take advantage of Montreal’s infamous nightlife. 

EngComm is the biggest international undergraduate case competition that caters to both faculties of business and engineering. Our week long competition challenges students with real world issues, typically provided by sponsors. The competition provides a platform for you to collaborate with students of the other faculty and an opportunity to show off for prospective employers.

1) how's the relation between students at tandon and students at the other nyu schools i.e. students at brooklyn and those at wsp. 

2) do students look down upon tandon and lsp kids? have you (tandon) guys had any experience where other program students look down upon you? just curious because i have a friend going to columbia, and he looks down upon barnard students. 

i was also going through some previous threads. And whenever there was a question like program x and tandon vs. program y at cas, tandon kids seemed so defensive. so what's with that?  

3) which program will the smartest kids of nyu be in? 

4) is a fake id really really required to be involved in the social scene at nyu?

5) i dont drink (or smoke) and i don't plan to in the near future. So will hinder my social life at nyu? a couple of people whom i've talked to, who're also coming to nyu, drink, go to nightclubs, etc. i haven't been to any nor have i consumed alcohol, so im apprehensive of doing that at nyu. so yeah, if any of you were like me, how did you/your social life change? 

6) why is the lsp program on? it looks like a program that cas rejects end up attending. it looks like a program that inflates nyu's acceptance rate. why are they accepting people who're not upto the quality of attending nyu? people like them would be bad????

7) if you get rich, like super rich (someone rich like john paulson, other billionaire or multimillionaire nyu alumni), then would you donate to nyu?

Well to be honest none of us know. The admissions committee makes the decisions and sometimes they are in your favor and unfortunately sometimes they are not.

When I was a senior in high school, I too asked these inane questions about whether I can get into a school or not. I can tell you right now that NYU was not my dream school. It was a school that I applied to basically as a reach, and I never thought that I would get in.

The case and point is that you should just apply, and worry less about whether you can get in. How does it help you to hear that you can or can't get in? Some people will be sycophants and say that you can, while others will discourage you. In my opinion, only you can determine if you can get in or not.

If you are ever feeling doubtful then read the dean of admission's blog post on decision day. Which, I have linked here. http://admissionsblog.nyu.edu/2016/03/29/decision-day/

He mentions that in 2016 NYU had room for the ""for students with healthy (not perfect) test scores. There was room for students with strong (not perfect) grades. There was room for students who didn’t serve as president or captain of everything and instead held down a part-time job to pay for college. There was room for students who didn’t win any awards but raced home after school each day to care for their younger siblings or their grandparents.

There was room for students who have struggled with depression and anxiety, room for students with excellent writing ability but unremarkable essays, and room for students who weren’t the best in show in all that they do but demonstrated they are good citizens and caring human beings.""

APPLY AND DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED BY FAILURE.

When I got rejected from dream school, my father told me ""Early success is one of the worst thing to
happen in early life. The next is losing spouse in mid-life or losing money in old life.""

6) if math is offered at NYU (the main campus) and at NYU poly, then how do employers (or you) differentiate between both the programs? Can some undergrad write courant on his resume if he/she studies at the WSP campus? And has that namedrop helped anyone, if used?

* SAT: 1460 - R&W 770, Math 690 - probably retaking, since I have to do the essay

* PSAT 1390

* IGCSEs: 4 A*s, 3 Bs, 1 A

* IB courses: HL English/ITGS/Art, SL Computer Science/Math/Spanish ab initio

* IB grades: 39/42 (three 6, three 7)

Awards and academic stuff: 

* 5th rank in IGCSEs out of 15 others
* Top 10% of my class of 80 (don't have a number, this is my guess)
* Honour roll for Term 1-2 in 11th grade
* Head of School award for Term 3 in 11th grade
* IB diploma student
* Couple of Olympiads taken in middle school

Extracurriculars: 

* Exchange programme in the UK, went to Britain for 3 weeks in 2011
* Duke University's Talent Identification Program: Forensic Science summer programme in India in 2012, Short Fiction Workshop online course in 2013
* Attended NASA Space Camp in 2013
* Lots of intra-school, inter-school, and regional-level quizzes and spelling bees, I count 6 quizzes and 5 spelling bees between 2009 and 2013 in which I placed well + 1 inter-school scavenger hunt in which I placed first (2014)
* Regular participant in the annual interschool competition hosted by my school, in different events - quiz, debates, creative writing - between 2008 and 2013
* 2.5 years of karate training, 3 years of table tennis coaching, 2 years of guitar classes
* 2x 5k runs and 2x 6k runs between 2013 and 2014

Extracurriculars 2:

* Volunteered for many donation drives in my school (natural disaster drives as well as annual donation drives for charity)
* Leadership position in my school's LEO Club (service club) where I organise fundraisers
* Organised a performance art piece for an arts festival in my school, and attended a workshop in animation as part of the same festival
* Volunteered at a school for refugee orphans almost every weekend throughout 2015
* Was a member of MUN Club, also participated in my school's MUN last year and am organising the MUN this year
* Volunteered for a Habitat for Humanity project where we painted a school for underprivileged children

Notes: 

The reason I split my extracurriculars into two is because I switched schools after 10th grade - the first part is my old school or individual stuff, and the second part is my new school. I was in a single school from kindergarten to grade 10, and then switched schools for grades 11-12. (In the Indian education system, there are two levels of matriculation exam, one at grade 10 and one at grade 12. Many students don't do both levels in the same school.) 

The opportunities available in my new school are very different and more varied which explains why the first part of my extracurriculars is quite different from my second part. 

I'm now in a boarding school which (I hope) sets me apart a little bit, since I already have some of that experience of studying away from home. 

I'm looking at NYU as a match school, and I'll be double majoring in Journalism and something else (undecided). Is this a realistic expectation for me?",0,1469375914.0,/r/nyu/comments/4udo90/what_are_my_chances_of_getting_into_nyu/,None

However, 14 meals per week gives an average of 2 meals per day, and what I am worried about is that it might not be enough for me as I like to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, religiously.     
While I have considered the fact that I will be having some meals out, I do not know how often I would be doing so and I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I want to eat on campus but am out of a meal plan.

1. 300 Flex (costs $41 more, but offers 75 more meals but 50 less dining dollars)

I just started out, so right now I’m looking for lots and lots of ideas but cant quite afford a full-time staff.  So, I decided to try to find people online and just pay per idea.  In the future, I would hopefully be looking to set up something more permanent.  

The types of ideas that I’m looking for require some imagination and creativity. These are not your regular tours and classes, but rather experiences, adventures, hacks and perspectives that you cannot find anywhere else.

I've been looking at internships for the fall semesters and had some questions that maybe those of you with more internship experience in the city can help answer:

1) So I have no work experience in the field of my major (econ). I had one previous internship that was completely unrelated and research experience in econ (but I'm not looking to go to graduate school or anything, so looking for internships.) My question is, with only some foundational and intermediate college courses in econ, how does one go about getting that first internship in their field? What do employers look for here?

2) Has anyone ever tried working during the school year? I know this to be one of the benefits of going to college in the city, that school year internships are supposed to be less competitive. But looking at some of the requirements of job postings, some of them are asking for ridiculous hours for part time (at least to me), usually 2 full days per week, or even 3 full days per week. I'm taking 18 credits next semester and I can drop this to 16, but regardless that seems like a pretty huge commitment in addition to academic work. Has anyone tried this? How hectic was your day-to-day, and did your social life suffer/health/sanity at all?

3) Just on the time frame of things, should I be worried if I'm unable to land an internship for next semester? I applied for a bunch for this past summer and did not hear back from any employer, so I'm starting to worry a bit as to whether I will lag behind, especially as I have so far had no related work experience.

4re4rh,ljonas234,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/4re4rh/should_i_leave_nyu/,Should I leave NYU?,"Looking for advice from current NYU students.

I’m not loving NYU. I just completed my Freshman year and I’m not looking forward to going back. It was a really hard year. I’m going to lay out some of the biggest reasons why I hated my first year and I would like some feedback on whether or not people think I should transfer.

1) The Culture- I’m from a pretty small town in the Midwest. I didn’t really fit in well there (lots of Trump supporters), so I thought NYU would be a good choice. The culture at NYU is unlike any other school that I’ve visited or heard about. There is no sense of community that I’ve seen. People keep to themselves, and you can’t tell who is even a part of the university and who isn’t. There’s a lot of judgment on the way people talk/act/dress/carry themselves. It made me afraid to leave my bedroom and go down to the basement to do laundry. I’ve never experienced social anxiety before this, but I definitely experience it now. 

2) The Classes- I’m in the Liberal Studies program. I had heard that it sucked but it’s actually horrible. Out of the eight professors I had my first-year, I only liked two of them, and only one of those two was a Liberal Studies professor (the other was Steinhardt). I had a professor that left one of our classes to “pick something up”, this was after he asked us what the cross streets of Bobst were, and before that he mentioned his drug problem (I think you get the idea). I had another professor that had us “make art” for our writing final. People submitted blurry photographs that they found on their phone and got As. I also had one professor that actively used the word “retarded” (it’s 2016 wtf). Other than these things I found myself uninspired in my studies, I didn’t do any of the readings and I still got a 4.0 (I did not earn that GPA at ALL). 

3) Dorming- I had a pretty bad year with my roommates. I lived in a suite, and had 4 other girls in there with me. I went into the year being super optimistic and determined to love and respect the girls I lived with no matter what happened. I was able to do this for about 4 months. I let them wear my clothes, use my things and make a huge mess that I would always clean up (vomit and used condoms included). It was fine for four months, but then it started to get to me and I became super upset with them internally (never verbalised). This anger started to eat away at me and change who I was as a person. When I stopped being the loving roommate that I was the first semester they all hated me. I stopped spending time in the room and I wasn’t super eager to clean up dirty dishes (they were never mine, but yes I cleaned them up). I caught them talking about me and saying some really fucked up things. I have developed a lot of anxiety and a shorter temper because of this and I’m trying to manage it now with meditation and medication. 

4) Friends- I didn’t really make friends this first year. It is SO HARD. I’ve tried to join clubs but the ones I’ve gone to don’t have any socialization time so it’s impossible to meet people. I only have about 4 friends now but they are always really busy and I don’t think I mean as much to them as they mean to me. I also have people that are anti-friends now, not enemies, but we didn’t really get along and now there’s a little bit of resentment. These relationships make me feel particularly shitty about myself, because I feel like the falling outs are completely my fault and I could’ve been better (I know I could have been but it really eats away at me every single day). 

These are the top four things that really affected my first year at NYU. I could probably add about 8 more little things that bothered me but they probably aren’t really relevant. Please give me any feedback, or how your first year went. I really appreciate it! ",13,1467743460.0,/r/nyu/comments/4re4rh/should_i_leave_nyu/,None

* GPA: 4.1 (Weighted 5-Point Scale) 3.63 (Unweighted) ~ My GPA is not the best because I took no honors in Freshman Year so my weighted was the same as my unweighted apparently and I have to factor that in?

* I duel enrolled and have taken a good amount of college courses at a community college here. Mainly business and legal electives, all As.

* 6 AP Courses, all Honors 10-12th Grades. 

* Recommendations from teachers, professor, principals, politician (local mayor) for service since I am wanting to go Poli Sci.

* Had internships with a State Representative, and State Senator. Served on a few campaigns as well as a intern.

* Founded Political Club, been very involved extracurricular wise

* Doing Early Decision / Have a lot of passion

I recently got my acceptance letter to transfer into NYU CAS, but they're very stingy with international transfer students and I didn't get any aid. I can technically afford to go and graduate debt-free, but for me to continue on my planned career trajectory I'd have to get a JD and then an LLM, which is more money and time. If I stayed in NZ, I would just have to get my LLM after I do my LLB. I intend to get my LLM in the UK since I plan to work in Europe.

My decision rests on the quality of CAS. I know NYU is renowned for its postgrad law school and Stern, but I'd be studying International Relations or Economics at the College of Arts and Sciences, which has a less gleaming reputation. For those of you currently at CAS, what is the intellectual calibre of the student body? What kind of opportunities are you offered in terms of internships and networking?

One thing that has always felt like a natural direction for the music I'm inclined to  create on my own time outside of the bands I play in and my day to day work,  is as soundrack music for film.  I’ve finally obtained a space where I’ve been able to set up a recording setup to capture my ideas specifically designed with an intention to present to filmmakers and musical directors.  

As a voracious consumer of scripted and documentary films, I’m constantly observing that my particular musical sensibilities seem to align with the choices many modern filmmakers and documentarians are settling on as the fundamental sounds that support their work.  

I’m utilizing any avenue I can in order to find collaborators that may be interested in working with me, and as a redditor, I thought this might be one more place to find a community in which to offer my services in exchange for a deeper understanding of how applying music to film actually works in practice. 

My goal in life is to wake up every morning and compose music all day.  I have an extremely eclectic background and range of musical interests and am open to, interested in, and capable of playing any and all styles of music, while approaching it in a unique way.  

My soundcloud link below is just a few unmixed, rough ideas I’ve been tossing around.  

If anyone, especially students or amateur filmmakers see this post and are interested in hearing more of my music, or a link to a finished documentary I have composed the music for, please PM me here.

4jv420,apissedoffstudent,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/4jv420/nyu_admissions_criteria/,"NYU Admissions ""Criteria""","TL; DR: I am rather perturbed that my friend did not get into NYU, even though he has won (and been a finalist in another year) the annual international cyber security competition that NYU holds.

So I would just like to let everyone know that I have a friend who has recently been rejected from NYU. Now you might say, ""You naive child, a lot of people get rejected from NYU, it is one of the most competitive schools in the world!"". And I will agree, it is very difficult to get into NYU, however this friend of mine has some rather interesting attributes that should make him ""stand out from the rest of the crowd"" if you will. For starters, he owns his own company. Granted, he is just beginning this company, but he has already closed on a few deals which suggests that he is doing pretty well. Ok, big deal, I know a dozen other kids that have their own ""companies"", he still doesn't impress me. Well, it also just so happens that my friend would be going to college to study cyber security, which as well all know from every single newspaper, magazine, news show and pretty much the rest of the Internet is going to have ""millions of jobs go unfilled"" year after year after year. It just so happens that the Tandon School of Engineering offers a Cyber Security Minor and NYU's name in the realm of Cyber Security has grown as a result of Cyber Security Awareness Week, an international cyber security competition for high schoolers that focuses on cyber forensics. Now by being a finalist in this competition, you immediately get a lot of scholarship money if you decided to attend NYU. And by winning this competition, you get a LOT more scholarship money. Now the kids who are finalists are the best high schoolers in the US at cyber security and it would make a LOT of sense for NYU to try as hard as they can to get these kids to come here as it would greatly benefit their cyber security program. Now my friend was not only a finalist one year, but he also WON the entire thing another year. So to even the most unbiased person, they would probably agree that he is pretty good at cyber security. Now, as you can probably imagine, these finalists are very smart kids and so naturally they are shooting for the stars for colleges (Ivy Leagues), so NYU probably isn't their immediate choice of school. My friend had told me, when he was a junior in high school, that he really wanted to go to NYU and would try to make himself truly be a unique applicant. Now I am no admissions person so I do not understand how this process works, but I like to think if I saw this person's information on the table, it would be very difficult to put them into the rejection pile.

So my question is; If NYU gives a darn about their cyber security program, why would they treat their most promising talent (who actually express interest in attending NYU) like garbage?

(I apologize for any grammatical errors, I would like to revise this, but I am too disgusted with how things have gone with admissions to do so)",0,1463548316.0,/r/nyu/comments/4jv420/nyu_admissions_criteria/,None

However, I've been self studying Japanese for a month now and the rate at which I'm pickin up the language is much faster than it was with Spanish. I think this is due to the similar grammar structure.

I really do want to double major in Finance and CS, or, say, Statistics and CS - just something that integrates business with CS lol. 

This is for a couple of reasons. One is because I plainly love programming, and the second is that I really want a technical degree under my belt after finishing undergraduate studies. 

So, to the point; how common is this? Would I have to fulfill the requirement of both CAS and Stern to do this? And, also, would I be able to graduate in 4 years. 

Thanks.",1,1462557120.0,/r/nyu/comments/4i68yd/how_hard_is_it_to_major_in_finance_at_stern_and/,None
4i59ya,FinishTheBucket,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/4i59ya/why_nyu_sucks_in_a_nutshell/,Why NYU Sucks in a Nutshell,"I'm a graduating senior who double majored, finished a minor and got an associates while I was in school. I also worked internships almost every semester I was on campus and paid my own rent by working food service and babysitting. This is to say, I am not a slacker not am I lazy. 

Earlier this semester, I dropped a class that in my department that I was misadvised I needed to take. The class met once a week and after the second meeting, I realized that the professor was a bully and I wanted no part of the class if I didn't need it. Lo and behold, when I checked my graduation requirements on Albert, I realized that I didn't actually need the class so I filed a petition to withdraw. Forty eight minutes passed between me leaving class and me emailing my advisor about dropping it. Because of the class only meeting once a week, the second meeting was after the drop deadline so I petitioned (successfully) to have the W expunged from my record. 

Last week, I checked my bursar account and realized that I still had not received my refund for this class. Curious as to why, today I managed to get time off work to go see the bursar. I walk into an empty office and go to one window to ask who I should talk to. This man proceeds to send me down the office to talk at a different window where I am barked at by a large woman talking on the phone and eating a breakfast sandwich that I needed to ""sign the sheet down there"" at the original window. This is in an empty office. From where I am standing I can see at least two employees on Facebook. 

So I go sign this sheet. Ten minutes of me waiting in an empty lobby later, someone deigns it worth their time to see one of the students they're working for (me). Once inside I am told that the bursar's office can't actually refund me because that is at the discretion of my school. Because why would the people in charge of the money at this school have the ability to give it back? That would make far too much sense for NYU. After being berated about how I am in the wrong place by a woman whose mousepad has pictures of her chugging a bottle of tequila on it, while her supervisor looked on, occasionally even helping her berate, I am sent elsewhere to have someone else deal with my problem. 

Now I'm sent across campus to speak with someone at CAS regarding getting my money back for a class I didn't take, that isn't on my transcript, that I was incorrectly told I needed to graduate. I'm told that I need to fill out another petition, this time for the ""refund of tuition"". 

I'm sent to yet another desk to get a copy of my originally approved petition to prove my case to the refund committee which meets once a month. Next Monday they will be reviewing my petition but my hopes aren't high.

NYU is a corporation, not a university. They do NOT care about their students and they WILL NOT help you in any way - they only care about squeezing as much money as possible out of you in your four too long years here. I have been consistently misadvised, told what I can't do and been blamed for all of the administrative shortcomings. Being berated by the bursar's office was honestly something I should have seen coming based on the way I have been treated by the school for four years. 

Do not take this to mean that the people at NYU aren't great; most of the students and professors are wonderful humans who care about what they do and want nothing more than their peers to succeed. The administration however is determined to let nothing get in the way between them and a direct pipeline to student's wallets. 

NYU, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Me, I'm personally ashamed that I didn't transfer out any of the three semesters I applied and was accepted elsewhere because I didn't have the courage to start over again socially. What I have learned is that people will help you; businesses couldn't care less. ",0,1462544337.0,/r/nyu/comments/4i59ya/why_nyu_sucks_in_a_nutshell/,None

Have some questions :D,"I know that a lot of people here ask questions that can be easily searched, but I've already searched 'cs' and browsed through lots of posts. A lot of people ask about easy CS classes or CS at Tandon vs CAS. My concerns aren't really related to those topics.

I'm currently a sophomore and by the time I transfer in I'll be an incoming junior. I've already taken courses equivalent to Intro to CS, Data Structures, Computer Systems Org, Basic Algorithms, Calc 1, and Discrete Math. So the only required course I would need is Operating Systems, and the rest would be electives. I'm contemplating about the combined CS/Econ path, so if you're majoring in CS and Econ pleaseeee talk to me! 

I browsed through the course schedule, and seems like Professor Gottlieb, who will be teaching Intro to Operating Systems isn't that great of a teacher according to RateMyProfessor. Are there better teachers who will teach the course in the Spring? How would you rate the workload? How many hours per week would you spend on the homework? At my school, OS classes tend to be electives, so I'm surprised and excited for this new challenge. 

Another elective in the fall that interests me is Object Oriented Programming, taught by Professor Shepard. Is this class also a heavy load? 

The reason why workload concerns me is that I want to be able to handle my classes while adjusting to a new school and its environment and people. My current CS classes take over my life, but I want an easier or lighter first semester at NYU, so that I can meet more people. 

Finally, how is the tech community at NYU? I've been to the HackNY hackathons, which are awesome. I've also tried applying to HackNY fellows, although competitive, the program and its mission are amazing. I've heard about Tech@NYU, and they seem like a very active group. Is there a close community in the CS department? Where do most CS students do their homework or meet together? 

Also, I'm interested in meeting new people! Feel free to private message me and introduce yourself! I'm from Boston, love working out and going to hackathons, and enjoy going to conventions or any kind of nerdy gatherings/scenes. Tech meetups and conferences are also my kinda thing.

[Highschool Junior],"The Megathread has been archived so I can't comment there, so I'll just ask here. Do I have any shot of being admitted into Tisch for film? I know the portfolio matters most, and I don't have anything to submit for it here, but I wanted to know if I have a shot at all. I am a white male junior living in a small Wisconsin town.  

My current GPA is a 3.5 with an upward trend. My dad had a bad accident which lead to brain damage my freshman year and my grades sucked that year. I got a 3.08. Last year I pulled a 3.83 and this year I am sadly pulling a 3.65. I am hoping to get it up to at least a 3.7 by the end of the the current trimester and hoping to get like 3.8-4.0 next year.  (My school doesn't have AP classes and only has 2 honors classes (I am taking the first this year)). I guess two other things to note is I only have 2 years of Spanish and I am done, but my middle school Spanish accounted for all of Spanish one. So I don't know if that counts as three years? I am also in Calculus. 

Besides this I have currently had a job for 9 months at a movie theater and have been promoted, I have been acting/ directing in local plays for the last 7 years, I won a state writing contest, and 2nd place in a state film contest. My biggest claims to fame is that I was in Moomah Magazine a magazine run by the Stewart family (of the Daily Show) for my art, and I was in the top 4 math films and somewhere in the top 75 over all (out of 8,000 some) for a Khan Academy contest. I am also an AV intern for my school and the local Arts Center, have been making films since 7th grade, longest being a 25 minute pandemic movie and a 30 minute Sci Fi Drama that I worked on for at least 6 months each. 

I haven't gotten my ACT scores yet, but I was tracking for lower 30s and if I get anything below 31-32 I will retake it till I get said score. Besides that I am planning on getting my letters of recommendation from my god father who is the Dean of the Manhattan School of music, my film teacher, and hopefully Jon and Tracey Stewart. 

I know this might seem like I am bragging about myself, but honestly I am really scared I won't be able to get in. NYU is my dream school and even if I ace my final trimester this year and my final year my GPA will still be below the NYU average. Not counting my portfolio, do I have any shot at Tisch? If not do any of you know any other good schools I could maybe get into?

I'm a HS senior currently hearing back from schools. Unfortunately, I was rejected from NYU, my dream-school, not just because I wanted to go there so badly, but because it would be so damn hard to get into that it was only in my dreams. I wasn't too surprised today when I opened my emails and saw my rejection letter, I had been expecting it for some time. Still, I know NYU is big into creative arts, primarily film, the field I want to work in when I'm older. With that in mind, I'd still love to attend. Alongside that, one of my friends will be attending SLU, and intends on doing film production while he's there- being in the city would be great for the two of us to collaborate. Unfortunately, neither of the schools I got into are nearby, nor prestigious in creative arts.


With all of this in mind, I wanted to know how hard it would be to transfer freshman mid-year, or sophomore year. I'd love to attend NYU- it's in the middle of one of the world's greatest artistic centers, it specializes in the fields I want to work in, and I'd be close by my other moviegoer friend.

Directly From the OFFICIAL NYU blog:
Admission to our Stern School of Business has become exceedingly competitive.  Stern is hot, plain and simple. Many of our applicants know this and want to be considered for other programs at NYU. Wonderful! But realistically, we’re likely to only seriously consider Stern applicants for one of our other business or management programs if we’re not able to admit them to Stern. We’re not likely to consider such students for other programs in the humanities (e.g. our Liberal Studies Core Program) or social sciences (e.g. our College of Arts and Science’s Economics program). Programs like Business and Technology Management (at our Polytechnic School of Engineering), Sports Management, Real Estate, and Hotel & Tourism Management (all at our School of Professional Studies) are the most viable alternative options for a student aiming to study business at NYU.


If you indicate that either an arts program in the Steinhardt School or the Tisch School of the Arts is not a first choice but instead a secondary/alternate choice (which is totally fine – go for it!), you should only attempt to arrange an audition or submit a portfolio if invited. The one arts program in our Steinhardt School that does not have an audition or porfolio review process is our Educational Theatre program. Similarly, our Gallatin School of Individualized Study, which also does not have an audition or porfolio review process, welcomes some students every year who audition or submit portfolios to Steinhardt and Tisch, and select Gallatin as an alternate program of interest.





____________________________________________________________________

Main points:


*Don't put CAS/LSP if you have Stern one of your choices. You're wasting space. If they see you have selected Stern, you will automatically be rejected from CAS/LSP. 


*Do put Tandon or School of Professional Studies as your back-up/safety schools if you choose Stern. 


*Do choose your major as Business and Technology Management in Tandon or Sports Management, Real Estate, and Hotel & Tourism Management at School of Professional Studies if you choose Tandon/School of Professional Studies as Safeties for Stern.


*Tisch or Steinhardt Can be selected as second choices


*Steinhardt Educational Theatre doesn't require a portfolio/audition.


*Select Gallatin as an alternate program of interest or safety when you are aiming for Tisch or Steinhardt.

1. I'm not sure if this is a mistake but instead of submitting a short film like people usually do, I sent them my whole reel. The reel includes all my animation/film stuff so I think it's good but I know NYU puts more emphasis on storytelling and that's where the reel lacks
Here's the reel if you wanna see: https://vimeo.com/147544344

2. We're only supposed to pick one medium out of four for creative expression. I chose film because that's what I'm good at but I completely forgot about the ""ONLY ONE"" medium thing and also sent them three graphic design pieces.

But I have a question now... So I had a pretty egregious error on my part, and mixed up my FAFSA dates for the different schools I was applying to. I missed the deadline for FAFSA and CSS. 

I got accepted, but there's no available information about financial aid on my Albert portal. 

So my question is: how exactly do scholarships work with NYU and the various schools? I know FAFSA is federal aid, and the CSS is for the school's aid. But my girlfriend, who's attending the University of Cincinnati was offered a Graduate Incentive scholarship from their school of music. Do the individual colleges have scholarships they award grad students independent of NYU? Does Steinhardt have TF or TA positions? Basically now that I missed FAFSA and CSS deadlines, are there any options for financial assistance? 

I called NYU's Financial Aid office and was rudely told that I missed the deadline and something along the lines of ""so you're actually still coming here?"" :(",1,1458630310.0,/r/nyu/comments/4bgevr/question_about_scholarship_and_finances/,None

46xb97,nwhyyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/46xb97/tandon_is_besmirching_my_intended_major/,Tandon is besmirching my intended major.,"At 2014 Tandon fully merged with nyu and coincidentally NYU's math ranking dropped a staggering 8 places (http://www.shanghairanking.com/World-University-Rankings/New-York-University.html). From past years before the full merger, there was some fluctuation over rising or falling ~1 place in rankings. It's no coincidence that at 2014, NYU's math fell from 13th place to 21st place and its still falling leading me to believe NYU's brand as a legitimate good math school is irrecoverable  due to the administration's shortsighted decision to merge.  I predict in the near future, less talented math students will apply to NYU due to its fall from grace and it will start a cycle between worse math students, worse faculty, worse funding, worse research, and even greater fall in math ranking. If I decide to pursue a major in math I will constantly have to dispel the assumption that I am a Tandon student majoring in math whenever the subject of majors come up. This is a hassle and it gives off a bad first impression that ""I was too lazy and unmotivated in high school to apply myself resulting in me attending Tandon"". 


Is it worth it to major in math even if I have to put up with the hassel? Should I switch majors to philosophy, it has a similar method of logical thinking. Or should I transfer to a school that doesnt butcher its own math program's reputation?  

P.S. I being completely honest here, not some PC bullshit about oh  every school is good/has its strengths as long as you work hard. Rank is there for a reason and you can ignore the statistics as much as you want but don't try to sell me on your PC ideals ( rank doesnt matter, you're pretentious, don't look at prestige, etc). If you're gonna spout some PC crap or use some ad-hominem attack, i will just ignore it.

It doesn't mean they are oblivious to their surroundings. It doesn't mean they go partying and clubbing everyday. It doesn't mean they don't have their own struggles.


If I google around, people are saying that NYU is full of lazy entitled brats. That is stereotyping NYU students. What about the scholarship kids? Are you going to invalidate all their hard work by assuming ""he's at NYU because his parents have money"". Sure some may be entitled but that isn't a choice and how would you know if they're lazy. That is discrimination under the assumption that entitled=lazy. You don't get into NYU by being lazy yet it is always assumed since you're overprivileged. This is classism against the overprivileged and some of you might think, ""oh cry me a river"", but if we let this slide then what kind of precedent are we setting for other prejudices? 


It leads to ""Its okay to discriminate the ______ because they are ______ ."" As in ""Its okay to discriminate the (overprivileged) because they are (overprivileged)."" Lets see this in racial terms, ""Its okay to discriminate (asians) because they are (asians)"" leading to ""oh hes good at math cuz hes asian"" or ""asians are robots that only know how to work""(aka dehumanizing another race so you feel less guilt about using stereotypical racial remarks)"".

2. Is there any of the following at either/both of Palladium/Coles: smith machine, tricep extension rope/cables, power cage, curl bars, chest press machine, butterfly, cable cross over machine?

3. Is there some kind of personal trainer for hire or lessons offered at the gyms that I could take if I'm having trouble as to how to use some of the equipment? Any assistance at all?

4. For those of you that workout and are on a meal plan, if I'm trying to gain weight and mass, what should my diet look like, especially logistically what dining halls meals are best for bulking? And also cheap places with large portions around campus?

5. And lastly, what are the peak hours in the weight room at Palladium and Coles (in the past?) Are there certain times when athletes/teams train that I should avoid? What are some of the NYU weight room etiquette and unspoken rules that I should beware of?

I haven't done stat before but plan on taking it as a senior. Investing class shouldn't be to difficult for me as I've already done this in a lot of other business classes in school. I'm also pretty intimidated by just going there. I won't know anyone and I'm a pretty quiet guy so I just wanted to know how the classes are like there. I just don't want to be there for 4 hours and sit there awkwardly. So, if anyone who's taken these classes before has some answers I would appreciate it.

First, my Mathematics For Economics class is going really sh*tty. The homeworks and quizzes are easy-peasy, I do very well in those areas, but for some reason this guy insists on giving the hardest midterms ever. I got a 73 on my first midterm and a 53 on this one. The averages in my class for both midterms were 79 and 56, respectively, so I know its not just me.

My Writing the Essay class is beyond frustrating, I work my ass off on these essays but only received a B+ and B- on the two of them. And the professor doesn't really give any constructive help, I mean she attempts to help and be thorough but doesn't really offer concrete suggestions or advice on what I should do. She often gives me advice like its cryptic code that I have to decipher and figure out, regarding content for my essay. Getting advice from classmates has been far more helpful. 

And in my Intro to Micro class, which is not bad whatsoever, I only got a B- on my first midterm. The results of the 2nd midterm aren't out yet (I studied a lot for it and I think I did really well), but I really expected to get an A in this course.

My freshman seminar course is going pretty well, but I don't think I'm going to get an A or even A- in the class like I wanted.

So yeah, right now, if I'm lucky and that Math class gets curved and I can get like a B in that course, I'm looking at a 3-3.3 tops GPA. I work hard and do my assignments early and study hard and go to office hours and try to get help, I'm not sure why I'm not performing at the level I wanted to.

I'm a prospective student and I'm kind of unsure if what I want to do if I get in NYU is even possible.

Anyone on this sub would like to shed some light on it?

However, admissions to that program is even more selective than to Stern itself, but I did find out that you can still get accepted into Stern if you get rejected from that program. I don't want to stay at Stern to study only Business though, so in that case I'd transfer out into CAS to study Economics. Is that possible?

I have an idea for a project I'm trying to pursue that requires knowledge of Java/JavaScript. I have basic knowledge of the languages but the project I want to start requires more advanced knowledge of Java and JavaScript.

Please let me know if you'd be interested in assisting with the project. Fellow alums or current students are welcome. The project involves the intersection of technology and finance so ideally I'd like to work someone with someone who has a strong background with Java and JavaScript and finance, but the interest in finance is not a requirement!

If you're interested we could meet up in or around the NYU area to discuss the project and see if it is something you'd be up for.

I am willing to compensate for your time (but please keep in mind I'm only two years out of school and paying off students loans! :/)

But here is a special deal for NYU students. if you present your NYU id card at the entrance, you will get in for just $5.

Here is how it works. The class begins at 9:30pm every Friday. you do not need to bring a dance partner because everyone will rotate to the next person and so you get to try out what you learn with everyone. But you can bring your friends of course and I encourage it. I will teach you the basics of the dance. After the class, the DJ will start the dance party and you get to dance all night long with everyone else who attended. If you do not want to take the class, just come at 10:15 or later to dance and have fun. This is a lot of fun learning and dancing with your friends or new people you meet there. And it is all for 5 bucks for a Friday night. Beverages are available for sale but you can bring your own drinks if you prefer.

If you do not know what salsa dancing looks like. Here are two videos of me dancing. So come and take a break from studying and have a blast.

The website for this class says that minors in foreign languages can count towards this requirement, and since I minored in ASL, I figured this would satisfy it. I petitioned, and I was rejected. Does anyone know of other fun classes that will fill the requirement, or if I can re-petition in a way that I'll be accepted?

Edit: Just thought I'd put this here in case someone searches for this in the future, but my initial petition was denied. I re-petitioned by saying the following: 

""To Whom it May Concern,

I recently petitioned this office for an exemption from the Expressive Cultures requirement on the basis of my American Sign Language minor that I feel satisfies this requirement. However, this petition was rejected because the content of my courses were not similar enough to those on the approved list of majors and minors for exemption from this requirement. The list of approved majors and minors that qualify to exempt students from this core requirement includes the following foreign languages:

French

German

Hebrew and Judaic Studies

Italian

Latin/Greek

Luso-Brazilian Language and Literature

Middle Eastern Studies

Romance Languages

Russian

Spanish


These majors and minors all focus on learning a foreign language, and are understandably interested in cultural practices of those respective language users. I fail to see how American Sign Language does not meet the same standards as any of these spoken languages. If this office feels that American Sign Language is somehow not as legitimate a language as the above listed, I urge you to delve deeper into this subject and perhaps read the syllabi for the courses taught at NYU. The courses I have taken have not only brought my language competence to that of near fluency, but have also discussed in great detail the cultural and historic significance of American Sign Language and the Deaf community. To me, there is no more expressive culture than Deaf culture. 

If it is possible, I would hope that this office will reconsider my previously submitted petition.""

I have a friend who got accepted for a graduate program at NYU, but was having trouble figuring out how to pay for it, and basically gave up.  Well, she figured it out, and everything seems good, but this late in the summer, all the dorms and such are apparently filled.

So...I was just wondering if anyone could offer advice about finding housing this late.  I know there are a bunch of apartment sites out there, but those things always seem so shady.  Is there a process for getting on like a dorm waiting list or something like that?  Or, maybe grad housing is different?

Which one should I select? What about their overall reputation in the area of Computer Engineering or Computer Science? Does Rutgers or NYU-poly has any reputation in Silicon Valley?

How is any of this fair, we pay as much tuition yet the other schools have these perks and we're only restricted to a cross school minors?
Yea I know, most students probably applied to CAS knowing this b/c their field of interest is mainly at CAS but its the principle that's involved that is so wrong. Our opportunities are limited just because a few administrators decided that lets not give a flying f@#% about the majority of our undergrad population. If you're gonna separate colleges, then do it right, if not then don't fuck over the single largest one.
Since NYU already likes segregating schools, you should break up CAS. College of English,lit,journalism, College of philsophy, college of historical studies, college of math and computer science, college of natural sciences, college of theology because apparently the bigger the college is the more Fuckable it looks to the administrators.

I'm learning more to just compsci since thats what I'm more interested in but I'm also curious about a joint with math. 


To the people at courant - Is the math going to be useful in compsci as opposed to taking more Compsci courses? 
will i be able to apply it to compsci in forecasting  /modeling/machine learning/ AI/Pattern Recognition?
Are the job prospects vastly different ?


I also want to learn about creating my own algorithms/ formulas in trading or gathering and processing data on the internet.

Are most of the subjects taught in your math classes less applicable to compsci related fields? Are there,like, really advanced mathematics that you'll learn in these classes that'll allow you to become some genius in compsci? 
Would there be a great disadvantage if i chose one over the other?

P.S I'm talking about the majors at NYU main. I have other courses that I'm deadset on taking so taking a joint would mean taking a few exemption exams.

I have been admitted to masters programs in computer engineering at UVA and NYU-poly and the admission offers at each school are as follows:

UVa: I have been admitted to Masters of Engineering in computer engineering at UVa. There is no scholarship or fellowship associated with this admission offer since master of engineering is a NO scholarship/fellowship program.

NYU-Poly: I have been admitted to the Masters of Science in computer engineering at NYU-Poly. I have received a graduate scholarship of $5000 per year. I maybe eligible for RA/TA-ships which is generally given after the first semester and that would mean no tuition fee.

I am looking to study and work in the field of parallel computing and multi-core systems modelling. I want to take up a JOB after masters and do NOT wish to pursue PhD.

My questions are as follows:

1.Which school is considered better for graduate engineering studies, particularly Electrical and Computer Engineering or Computer Science?

2.Which school would be better in terms of job prospects? ease of securing a job/ statistically better job placements?

3.USnews ranks UVA at 39 and NYU-poly at 47 in computer engineering program. Does ranking mean much in making a decision, particularly in this case where the difference isnt that high?

My questions basically boil down to whats a better choice in terms of quality of education+wealth and ease of jobs at the time of graduation??

I would appreciate all the info and help you could provide on this topic.

I also have seen plenty of people say that the school along with the connections/reality of being in NYC make it a good school to go to, even for the cost. One person even brought up a chart from 2013 that had NYU's eng school at number three for return on investment  Also, how true was that figure and how'd it fair with the 2014 class?

31cewe,Nesiss,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/31cewe/okay_guys_we_need_to_talk_about_a_few_things/,Okay guys we need to talk about a few things...,"   Okay, I've been lurking here for quite awhile and I've noticed a couple of glaring issues about this sub-reddit. I just got accepted into NYU in the Tisch school for film but I've been coming to this sub-reddit for the better part of a year and the biggest issue I've found is that there isn't discussion about the intricacies of the school, funny things that happen around campus, creative ventures that relate to the campus or teachers, et cetera et cetera. Just look at the top posts of all time, everything up there is creative, funny, and just overall good content, and if you all want to see this sub become a better community like I do please here me out. 

   I've noticed that the majority of questions posted here only relate to newly accepted students and the questions they have about their majors, questions about housing, people complaining about the tuition, and people complaining and putting down the school in general. I know that no place is perfect but I mean it has been getting a tad excessive. 

So here are my suggestions for cleaning up this sub:

* Direct all the questions to a weekly ""General questions thread"" or ""Newly accepted student thread"" and since all questions will be directed to that thread there will be a lot more breathing room for good content and discussion. Plus even if we never make any new content the sub will be cleaner because of it.

* Can we be more positive? Yes I know it's important to talk about serious and pressing issues because without them we would never have any sort of real discussion, but all I ask is for those topics to be left out of regular discussions and just kept on their individual threads unless it's in response to a very specific question. For example: 

Jen: ""Oh my God I absolutely love Hayden, the guy from down my hall is such a cutie teeeheee :p""
                                                                                                                           
Billy: ""Yeah but it's not worth the $71,000 tuition fees, the faculty are no help, and the 
staff are selfish pricks. Better give up now.""

* We should encourage the use of the search bar more. There's such a multitude of topics now available that most of everyone's questions should be answered. It would also help to keep this sub clean.

P.S. I know that some of you guys will want to argue with me and disagree with me. That's okay but I'm not trying to start anything. I'm just a small-town guy who really wants to see this sub and community succeed. I think this place can become a great summary of all the talent and creativity that exists on the NYU campus. So please before you argue with me or pick me apart, just ask yourself if you are making this sub better or just adding to the layers of complaints and negativity that already exists.


P.P.S. Mods if you're still around can you give your feed back as well? I would love to help out in anyway I can to push this place foreward.


P.P.P.S. If anyone has anymore ideas please feel free to post them, I'd love to talk with you about them.",0,1428089950.0,/r/nyu/comments/31cewe/okay_guys_we_need_to_talk_about_a_few_things/,None

I apologize for the length of this, I'm hoping this is the appropriate place to post this, but if it's not please let me know. A few weeks ago, I found out that I was admitted to the Martin Luther King Jr., Scholar's Program at NYU. Needless to say, I'm absolutely ecstatic with both the 45k scholarship and benefits that come with all of this - it's been a dream come true. Honestly, I think I'm still in shock. I'm almost positive that I'll be accepting the offer, however I was wondering if anyone may be able to answer a few questions concerning the program? 


Primarily, I'm curious about the involvement with the program, how it works, summer internships, etc. I know that NYU's site says a few things about ""international travel colloquia"" with the program, but could anyone clarify that a bit? Really, if anyone could highlight differences (if there are any) between the ""scholar's"" experience at NYU versus the ""regular"" experience, I would be so incredibly grateful. 

I apologize for the request - I know this is a lot, and a bit strange! I couldn't be more excited to go to NYU, however I just want to be totally clear what I'm getting into. Thanks everyone!",1,1428085501.0,/r/nyu/comments/31c4pz/questions_concerning_scholars_program/,None

Whoooo...) a few days ago like a lot of people.

The Parent Loan Plus brings $35000, along with two offered student loans for $5,500. Now the $35000 loan is very expensive and I don't plan to go in debt, plus my parents just can't afford it. Does anyone here have any ideas to supplement that cost? I've applied to various scholarships but none have responded yet. I would really love to go to my dream school, but Stony Brook University is offering a package that only leaves us paying roughly $6000 for the year, which is very much doable. I'm willing to go to SBU, but if there's anything that could supplement the expenses for NYU I would gladly take it up.

30v4lu,_Jonezy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/30v4lu/help_deciding_whether_to_come_to_nyu/,Help Deciding Whether To Come to NYU,"Hello,

I am a high school senior from Connecticut who was recently accepted into the Liberal Studies Core Program at NYU. CAS didn't want me, apparently. I applied to NYU expecting to not get in, so being accepted is really stressing me out. I *believe* the liberal arts program would be good for me considering I am not positive as to exactly what I want to study, being a kid and all. How the hell am I supposed to know what I'd like for a career? Excuse my rambling.

Anyways.

My first option is to go to my state school, UConn and major in something related to Digital Media/Design (which I thought I was interested in, but now I am having second thoughts) for about $25000 per year. It's located in a very rural area. I was told all but one graduate of my current major has had a job lined up coming out of graduation. Second option is the much, *much* more expensive NYU where I would study liberal arts for 2 years and then choose a major and attend another NYU, provided I complete required applications and such. This option would cost me about $70000 per year, which really scares me. I'm a relatively down to earth guy, trying to hold the mindset of ""there's more to life than money"" and ""its just money, it can be paid back"" but I'm having a hard time convincing myself, hence why I am asking the users here (and elsewhere) for advice. Majors that interest me at NYU are digital communications/media, urban design/architecture, english, media culture/communications, integrated digital media, mechanical engineering. As you can see, I'm pretty set on what I want to do.

Aside from general advice, can anyone speak of their experiences of the core liberal studies program and moving on to another school? How they are managing NYU super debt? Has your time at NYU been worth the money?

My teacher can't stop trying to convince me that I'd benefit more from going to NYU rather than UConn, but you know. Money. So many things interest me so it's difficult to choose a school over another just because of the majors it offers. I feel like which ever path I choose, I will become a very different person.

As always, any advice is appreciated.

EDIT: Some financial information: my parents are divorced, mom makes about $80000 per year, I don't talk to my dad/he's unemployed. My sister attends a private university which costs about $25000 per year which she pays for with small loans and working around the clock. Either school I go to, *I* will have to take out loans, not my family.
EDIT2: Is there any way I can get better financial aid? I submitted FASFA and CSS past the deadline because mother was derping.
EDIT3: I did some more digging, and it seems I wasn't given aid because I didn't send a ""CSS Noncustodial Profile Waiver Request""? I was completely ignorant to the fact that I had to send this. So dumb of me. It says no late acceptations but I'll try sending one anyway.",2,1427757660.0,/r/nyu/comments/30v4lu/help_deciding_whether_to_come_to_nyu/,None

Albert stated my total estimated cost for the school year would be $64,000. My parents are willing to help me pay $20,000 a year for school.

So, $64,000 - $28,000 - $20,000 = $16,000.

Therefore, optimistically assuming my scholarship money remains stable for the four years I'll be at NYU, I'll have to handle paying $16,000 a year to NYU myself.

Is it realistic to assume that I'll be able to acquire a paid campus research position to pay off my loans? Or be able to acquire various jobs over the summer to put a dent on my possible $72k out-of-school debt? (Anything else I should consider in the way of making money while in school?)

Additionally, I plan to go to law school after NYU. Will the rabbit hole just continue growing?

And lastly, I got accepted at a decent in-state school (William and Mary) that'd cost me $29,000 a year. NYU is my first choice simply because my strong desire to experience its ""non-traditional"" campus offerings and my respect for its research. Will the debt I will possibly accrue while at NYU be worth choosing it over my in-state option?

I applied under radio and television in the Communications school because I didn't think I had the portfolio for Tisch at the time, however after my senior year I feel I have definitely grown as a filmmaker and desperately want to transfer into Tisch for filming and I am curious how difficult of a task this may be after my first year.

We take sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking seriously.

>NYU has long had support services and highly trained staff in place to respond to reports of sexual misconduct. But the national discourse about sexual violence on campuses across the U.S., along with new federal mandates and our ongoing desire to continuously improve programs and services for our students have prompted us to look closely at our own policies and practices.

>As was recently announced, we have a new policy in place that streamlines and improves our procedures and adds more support services for students- including centralizing the investigation and adjudication of sexual misconduct matters, establishing a special new service to support survivors of sexual misconduct, and offering education and training to students, faculty and staff. 

>As always, we encourage any member of the NYU community to report any act of sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking. We take each report seriously and follow-up on each and every one of them.

>Within this context, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with our new policy on Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking, as well as the services and resources we offer all students, by visiting our website at www.nyu.edu/sexual-respect.

>In our continuing effort to prevent sexual misconduct, to raise awareness and understanding and to foster a community in which members value each other's rights in this area, **we are requiring all students to complete a new on-line training course on sexual misconduct called Think About It.** This online course examines the interconnected issues of healthy relationships, hooking up, substance abuse, and sexual violence, among other topics, through a variety of scenarios and guided self-reflection.

>We estimate that this course will take you about 60 minutes to complete. You can work at your own pace from any computer (requires Flash player); you can leave and return to the course at any time, and when you return, it will open to the page where you left off.

>Begin by logging in to NYU Home and finding the button on the Student Life tab called ""Sexual Respect Training Login"". You can also access it by visiting www.campusclarity.com and entering your NYU Home credentials.

>**The deadline for completing the module is April 15, 2015 - completion is necessary for Fall 2016 enrollment.**

>As always, we welcome your feedback as to how we can improve this on-line training course. If you need help, wish to provide feedback or have questions about the module, please contact the Wellness Exchange at (212) 443-9999 or wellness.exchange@nyu.edu. There are local phone numbers to reach the Wellness Exchange around the world - whether you are in NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, or at an NYU global site.

>Thank you for participating in this important training. We hope you agree that requiring students to complete this on-line course is an important step we must take in promoting a healthier and safer campus environment for everyone. 

>Best wishes for a successful Spring 2015 semester.

That being said... I was planning on emailing these sort of 'prospective student inquiry questions' to one of the CUSP professors, but I feel I could get very valuable information here first, and make a stronger first impression via email later. Hoping there are some NYU CUSP Students lurking about. 

**So how has it lived up to your expectations? How has it fallen short?**


**Edit:** 

*My Background*

* So I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2013 in Applied Math & Environmental Hydrology. My GPA is bad, so I focused on internships. I now have 5 years worth experience, and doing really cool stuff in forestry mapping, agricultural water-use, sustainable technologies. Day-to-day work focused on ArcGIS and data management, and I see my limits from not being taught proper informatics/data management/python scripting. I've always been drawn toward Urban Planning/Urban Sustainability/Community Development, but I want to learn more translatable technical skills like data analysis, along with sector specific knowledge like Urban Planning. Looking at the [curriculum](http://cusp.nyu.edu/curriculum/), NYU's program seems to be a great combination of that.

What irritates me is that I don't understand why I gave into taking the retake when I should have just argued. 

In the end, I got an F in the class. I feel like this grade was predetermined. Professor hated my guts because he didn't appreciate my criticism to him earlier in the semester. 

What I want to do is anonymously complain about this professor and his grading rubric in this course. Should I? Who do I contact? 

I need you guys to understand how much of a dick this guy is. Such a dick. I've never been this pissed at a professor in my four years here. 

On top of that, next semester would have been my last semester. Should I split my semester now, half Spring and half Fall, or take my normal load next semester and just take that one course I failed in the fall? I should include that I may have scored a full time job which is in CT.

Im an aspiring actress at Rutgers University. I've been doing musical theater, opera & acting for the better half of my life. Now I'm looking to find roles in student films. Rutgers has a small digital filmmaking program which I am also reaching out to, but I thought I should try here as NYU is one of the most prestigious programs in the tri-state area. I'm going to attach my resume and headshot.

If anyone, and I do mean anyone in the film program at NYU thinks they could use me in a role I'd be more than happy to audition and work for free. I really want to get some great short films under my belt (some work outside of theater) and I thought NYU would be the place to look. Although I just made this account, I've been lurking on reddit quite a while and I figured posting in the subreddit for NYU might be the best place to start my search for fantastic student films.

If you want to contact me just send me a PM!

Really hoping to hear from some of you!

So i'm currently a freshman here, in the CAS Math/Econ program.
However, I've kind of realized that forcing myself into a field I don't particularly have personal interest in isn't the best use of my time in college.
I was particularly interested with transferring to Gallatin, to pursue my interest of Western Literature, but also combine that with practical studies, like computer science or finance.
Also, since I would have finished Linear Algebra at the time of transferring (end of freshman year), I believe I would also be able to apply for a math minor.
Do you think this is a reasonable plan/would my degree have practical value?

I'm a sophomore in the inaug class at NYUSH. We're a pretty small community and we don't hear a lot about the goings on of the motherland at Washington Square. Some of us have never even been there (myself included). 

What sometimes concerns me is that whenever one of our own finds an article from NYUNY that mentions us, it seems like it's always something negative. I for one don't see any reason that NYUNY and NYUSH students should be putting ourselves in separate camps, so I wonder if it's not just the desire for sensationalism that leads my classmates to only find and share negative pieces with each other, and if the conception of NYU students about us isn't as bad as we here feel it is. 

So my question is, what is the general opinion at Washington Square of your classmates at the Portal Campuses (AD and SH?) 

(Mind you, I'm not doing this on behalf of any particular group of students. I'm just asking for myself)

EDIT: Thanks for the replies, guys. That's pretty much what I thought. The sentiment here is more or less the same. Whatever the political concerns and financial nightmares that revolve around NYUSH/NYUAD, I think it's important that NYU's students speak with a single voice. (and for the record, from where I'm standing, NYUSH's voice is saying much the same thing as you guys on those points). Zaijian, friends",4,1416548189.0,/r/nyu/comments/2myiss/nyu_shanghai/,None

I'm a senior in high school from Long Island who is applying ED II to NYU. I actually went to several Open Houses over the weekend (Steinhardt on Saturday, Gallatin on Sunday), and I've solidified my decision to apply to Gallatin as my first choice. My other choices are CAS and Steinhardt, but I believe I put down CAS as my second school of choice on the Common App.

Since Gallatin is such a small school in NYU, I'm worried that they won't have too many openings for upcoming undergrads. Is it true that they accept about 200 - 260 students per year? Does this mean Gallatin is extremely competitive, or do most people choose to apply to other schools over Gallatin? 

If it's possible, I'd like to keep in contact with some of you so I can ask more questions through emails over the course of the next couple of weeks. I'm also going to the Diversity Opening House on November 15th, so if I could meet up with any of you over a cup of coffee that would also be great. 

Also, I've seen a couple of other students give their stats away here, and even though I know admissions can be a bit sporadic, it'd be helpful if some of you could take a look at some of my stats. 

Junior Year GPA Transcript: 3.68 Unweighted, 3.89 Weighted

SAT: Superscore 2030, but planning to take the December SAT I test and get a 2100 - 2200 and rush the scores. 
SAT II: None worth submitting.

AP Courses: AP World (10th grade), AP English Language (11th grade), 
AP Biology (11th grade), AP United States History (11th grade), AP Psychology (12th grade), AP AB Calculus (12th grade), AP Drawing (12th grade), AP Human Geography (12th grade), AP French (12th grade)

College Courses: Syracuse University Project Advanced WRT 105 (12th grade)

Extracurriculars: Art Club, Intercultural Unity, National Honors Society, Foreign Language Honors Society, Youth Internship Program, Teach Assitant

Job experience: Secretary work

This is an awesome internship; instead of forcing you to do the bitchwork, you're encouraged to participate in the creative process. They actually want to hear your ideas. They are also the team that helped make Prince Avalanche and Compliance which y'all indie-loving motherfuckers should eat right up. Lastly, they're really looking for those of you who have experience with photoshop (which is way more likely if you're on reddit) or any video-editing, but if you're just passionate for films, then go ahead and apply any way.

DOGFISH ACCELERATOR is the first seed accelerator program for content creators. We work with cutting edge producer teams to help them build out their production companies and projects in a way that promotes financial viability and creative freedom. Dogfish is excited to announce that we are accepting interns to come work with our staff and teams for the fall program. You will have the unique opportunity to closely collaborate with our staff and a variety of our talented (and equally goofy) producer teams. While these are unpaid positions, you will be trading your time for valuable experience, including a series of workshops about funding, distribution and other business aspects of the production process. Must be able to commit 2-3 days per week and get credit. Areas include Production, Post- Production, Research, Graphic Design, Social Media and Web Development.

Gallatin '06 here.  From the alum office's emails, looks like its move-in-day! First of all, congrats on choosing NYU.  Second of all, you are in for a tremendous four years.

I remember in 2002, driving up to Hayden Hall with my brother and thinking -- ""this is going to be interesting.""  And interesting it was.  I met my best friend Dan the first day and we're still great friends.  I studied poetry with NYTimes best sellers, studied art history at the Met, go to walk through the stock exchanges.  I survived the blackout, the DNC protests, and the snowstorms.  NYU was an amazing time for me.

Here are a few things I learned that made NYU even better:

1. Go to museums, jazz shows, broadway shows, Yankees games.  NYU students get great discounts at all of the great establishments in NY (and in the world).  Go!  There is no time better than as (broke) student to go see these things for free.


2. Meet people.  I know its NYU and NYC and everyone is fairly pretentious :D, but NYU has some of the most amazing people I have ever met.  Everyone is as shy, awkward, and as tense as you are -- don't forget that.  Just say ""HI!""
3.  If you're from NJ, CT, or NY, don't go home until Thanksgiving.  The weekends were the best time to form solid bonds with friends.  Home will almost always be there.
4.  Check out other boroughs -- the free Staten Island ferry ride past the statue of liberty was my go to date spot!  and who are you kidding, you're a broke romantic.
5.   Get out of your comfort zone.  In Steinhard, but interested in computer science?  Great go take a class in the Math department.  Interested in Philosophy, but studying at Stern? Go take a philosophy course at CAS.

6.  Have fun.  Sophie's on 5th and A doesn't card :D",18,1408980736.0,/r/nyu/comments/2ejc1o/good_luck_freshman_enjoy_nyu_a_few_things_to_make/,None

The first two classes I'm definitely taking because they're Stern requirements but I looked up the syllabi for the latter two and they're looking less than ideal. I was wondering if anybody could give a bit of feedback on these courses and their professors, and/or offer suggestions as to which classes I should replace them with.

It is 1:30am my time and can't think because of this.
So this is what I have to show:

I am a white male

-My projected GPA at my time of transferring will be around a 3.4 (I did poorly in my freshman year but have improved leaps and bounds, I matured a lot and started taking school seriously)

-I will have completed 63 units (not expecting all to transfer)

-I will have over 100 hours of community service (cancer society and animal shelter)

-I was the assistant sports editor for my CC newspaper

-I have held my current job for over 3 years

-I founded a software company a year ago and with this round of funding my company will be worth around 300k (my company has yet to bring in profit and has yet to launch the product so value will most likely sky rocket by the time I apply, excuse me if I sound pompous I really don't mean to)

I have trouble figuring out a good strategy for college, hope you guys have advice! So here's the situation : I am French, I just completed a visiting student (non-degree) program at NYU, I am a Freshman (no home university, just graduated from high school) I applied as a Freshman and got rejected, they said that they rejected me because they were not able to evaluate my application, that I was in a glitch, being a freshman-visiting-applying-student was apparently a unique situation among the 55 000 people that applied this year, and they didn't want to make an exception about it. Anyway, I argued with them, without success.
So now, I try to find a way to come back to NYU (or other school in the US). A lot of people told me about CUNY, (Baruch and Hunter) and I really don't know what to do, I really want to stay in NY, but are those schools a good way of transferring?

Anyways I got accepted to both schools, and I was wondering if you guys could shed some light on their computer science and engineering programs.

As of now, it seems that RPI is a better choice (ranking-wise, SATs, and all that stuff), but with the recent merger, do you think Poly will start to flex their ""reputation muscles"", and eventually take the lead? Also, do you find that Poly students only get jobs in NYC, rather than other areas like the west coast?

I was recently accepted into Stern which is by far the best school I was accepted at for my major, accounting. If anyone is familiar with the program or could offer any insight into the rigor and job opportunities I would love to hear from them. 


I love stern because its right near all the big firms and I want to go into corporate accounting. However I have a few big concerns. First Stern is by far the most expensive of my options, especially compared to my state school. Also I’ve never really been to NY of big cities in the north and I’m just kind of off put by the whole environment. I’ve always got the impression it’s very aggressive and pushy with abrasive people, a lot of Jews as well as kind of dirty. I’m from a small town and am kind of afraid I won’t fit in. That being said it is the best school for my major and I’d be willing to pay the high fare it means better job opportunities. 


So if anyone could help me understand what the program/life is like at Stern it would really help me in making this decision. Thanks a lot, and I might be seeing some of you pretty soon!

I'm having a tough time deciding between NYU Stern and UCBerkeley.
Would be great if you could assist me in making a decision.
I want to go into Investment Banking but at the same time double major in eng/cs(atleast a minor in CS) 
Now, here's how I see things: 

* Berkeley: disadvantage -biz school(Haas) starts 3rd year + you aren't guaranteed admission
* Location: NYU wins cuz NYC 'nuff said. 
* Tuition: Berkeley wins. 
* Student Body: Berkeley wins, NYU has lower admission standards in general and Berk. is known for being extremely competitive.
* Stability: NYU, (You still have to apply to Haas junior year to major in biz but NYU guaranteed admission to Stern)
I've heard that Haas is better for Consulting jobs and Stern for Finance
*  Campus: Berkeley wins( NYU doesnt really have a campus)
* CS: Berkeley wins hands down.
Now it may seem like I'm leaning towards Cal. The thing,however, is that Stern is #1 ranked for finance and particularly renowned for IB recruiting and has better recruiting from Wall Street IBs like Goldman Sachs. CS matters to me but only to a certain extent, I'm leaning more towards finance and will use CS as a complement so that I may have some technical skills.

That being said, how difficult is it to transfer to CAS?

I understand that if I try to transfer after a single term at Bing, only my high school grades will be looked at.

Also, I plan on becoming a biochemistry major. I plan on taking my general chem and calc courses at Bing, but are there any other courses that you guys recommend that I take so that I can knock off a few of NYU's core requirements for CAS?

Some context: I'm currently a freshmen with a required meal plan living in a non-apartment style dorm. I've been lifting for about 4 months now, and I've been able to put on a decent amount of weight eating at Kimmel (Habanero yumm), Hayden (grilled chicken) and UHall (more grilled chicken after Palladium workout). I sort of inadvertently cut over winter break--there aren't many healthy options when your friends want McDonald's, so I would skip some meals--so I'm down to about 153 from 160-ish before last semester ended. 

Now I'm again realizing that I need to bulk again--been stuck at the same weight on squat, OHP, and bench (though surprisingly not on deadlift--but I just don't find many of NYU's meal plan options so appetizing. If I could, I'd eat Kimmel burritos all day (except between 3-5. Screw that), but I feel like that'd be a dirty bulk. I can't really stand most of Hayden's food except for some of the pasta and the grilled chicken, but even then I always end up unsatisfied and hungry later on. Quiznos chicken subs are good at Upstein, but again, I feel like that's a dirty bulk. 

So for those NYU weightlifters out there, what do (or did) you do if you bulked as a freshmen with a meal plan? I'm eager to get into a dorm next year with a stove so I can cook my own clean bulk recipes, but for now the meal plan'll have to do. Thanks.

Hello fellow NYU Redditors. 

I am a freshman this year at NYU^yay!

I have a modest background in Java and OOP, the biggest projects  I've ever done mainly involved games. I've worked with arrays of objects, and basic OOP tools such as abstract classes inheritance polymorphism ect. However I haven't yet had the chance to work with more advanced data structures such as linked lists, hash tables/maps,  or heaps. 

My dilemma is that I have the chance to either  *Intro To Computer Science-101*  or  *Data Structures-102* this semester. So far I've been going to both classes and 101 seems to cover what I already know, but its hard to tell just a week in. So far 102, however, deals with problems more abstractly , which is fun, but I don't really have a reasonable grasp of what kind of coding ability I should have going into this. Could I actually do well in this class?
So if any of you kind people has any personal or second hand experience with one or both of these classes, any kind of insight would be much appreciated!


TL:DR
Should freshman with some Java take CSCI-101 or CSCI-102?

So for you film majors out there, what were your GPAs/SATs? About how large is the program? Did you apply for early decision? Also, are you minoring in something like screenwriting or business? In the program, do you focus more on the creative parts of filmmaking, the technology part, or equally both? And how do you like the program overall?

NYU is my dream school, the only problem is my academics. hehe, yeah... 

I'm rocking a 3.2 GPA going into junior year. I've fucked up big time, and really have no excuse. I'm gonna work my ass off and try to get a 4.0 Junior year, and that would bump me up to 3.46. If I get another 4.0 senior year, I'll have an acceptable 3.6 unweighted. I've been taking some SAT practice tests, and will end up with something in the 2000's by the end of Junior year.

My GPA would end up as 3.1-->3.3-->4.0-->4.0

What can (hopefully) help me out is that I play tennis, and probably have the skill-set to be recruited for the mens' team. What I'm wondering is if being a recruited athlete will help me at all in the application process. Does anyone have any experience or know someone with one in regards to athletics? Does being an athlete make any difference in the process?

I'll be applying to CAS, have decent ECs, and could probably write a decent essay considering NYU is by far my first choice.

Thanks for the help.

I intend for it to be a place for college applicants to go, and trust to give them everything they need.  Answer basically any question they have, and provide any resource they need.

I think that what separates this from sites like Princeton Review is that most college reviews ask questions of the reviewers that are too general.  This leads kids to omit certain information.  Information that college applicants would want to know!  I thought hard about what kids would want to know (and asked other people), and I came up with a bunch of questions.  I think that if I could get people to answer them, this would be a great resource for college applicants to get their questions answered!

Ive gone probably 5 times or so. The first time i went i got food poisoning(which isn't much fun) from the hot buffet. Another time I was in the area and had an urge for pomegranate, so i went in and bought a small container of already seeded pomegranate. I then went to bobst and noticed it had mold all over it. Just my luck. This summer im taking summer classes and thought to give space market another chance. Ive gone twice this summer during a break in my class. The first time was no problem. The second time however, u guessed it again, I got food poisoning from the hot buffet. To back up the fact that it was space market and not another source getting me sick, I actually got food with 2 other students, who got similar food to me, who also got food poisoning. I unfortunately ate more then those two girls and at the moment am in bed trying to hold back the inevitable chocolate explosions that ive been having all day. to make matters worse, one of these girls went back to complain today and was yelled by the manager. She was rudely disrespected and talked down to by the asshat that runs that sickening market. So please NYUit, stop going to space market. Yes its convenient, but at what cost. Plus you only fund them to keep on making their ""great"" food. If you need a substitute source of quick food. go to upstein, m2m, Le Basket(on broadway), brads or any other source of food.

TL;DR  :  DONT GO TO SPACE MARKET. Ive had food poisoning a couple times. I also know of 5 other people who have also had food poisoning. Also i will be making a call to sanitation or whatever er agency deals with these types of things to make a complaint(im sure im not the first).

The other thing is due to the lack of friends, I didn't party or go out at all; the lack of a fake and the somewhat high costs of going out didn't help either. I really want to have some fun here, but I just don't know how to even begin to fix this problem.

My friend who's going to NYU Stern next year told me that on the application, you can check off NYU Stern and ALSO check off ""I would also like to be considered for CAS"" just in case you dont get into Stern, you can still go to CAS. Is this true?

Also here are my stats... what I'm worried about is my GPA...

GPA: 3.6 UW/4.5, 3.8 weighted out of 4.5, which IF I'M DOING PROPORTIONS....3.6 weighted out of 4.0.

SAT I: 1950, 2120 on 2nd try (a large improvement)
SAT II: anticipating a low 700 for Math II and high 600 for US History lol

APs: anticipating 4/5 on APUSH, Micro/Macro economics, 5 on AB Calculus

senior year Im taking 4 more APs

I have a LOT of actually solid ECs: president of FBLA, state assembly representative of JSA, boy scouts for 7 years (won't make eagle scout though), lots of clubs/leadership in the clubs, played at Carnegie Hal 2x for piano, won a lot of piano competitions.... 

also I'm gonna get 2 very good teacher recs AND a rec from a NYU professor at Steinhardt (which isn't NYU Stern but still) so that might help me out :D **edit: I'm getting the rec because Im doing an internship for him/her this summer. also Im doing that internship and maybe getting another job over the summer in fashion.**

tbh NYU fits me like a glove, I cant see myself going anywhere else. also I come off as an intelligent/anti-society person so like a hipster........ businessman, i dont fucking know

can I get into Stern or should I try my luck at CAS? or can I do the above listed application method still.......",0,1369597822.0,/r/nyu/comments/1f3h7m/my_chances_of_getting_into_nyu_stern_and_a/,None

With NYU, I have been accepted by the Computer Science program in CAS, though I might plan on transferring to the Tisch school of the arts (Film/Television is something I really enjoy).  I enjoy the city life, living an hour away in New Jersey, but I acknowledge that costs are high.  With Carnegie Mellon, I have been accepted into the Information Systems program, a combination of business and computer science. This field was suggested by a friend, but I don't know too much about it.  CMU has a good arts program as well, so I might dabble in their.  In terms of financial aid, my parents and I will still need to pay around and over $50,000, though CMU has offered more financial aid so that it is $5000 cheaper than NYU.

I'm looking to major in Computer Science and Math (the joint degree). Overall, I like NYU better. My parents can pay part of the 30k for the next few years, but ultimately I will be in some debt when I graduate. I don't know whether the cost is justifiable. I've thought of applying to outside scholarships, and/or graduating a semester or two early (I have a good amount of AP credits) to reduce costs. I know cost is important, but isn't the overall college experience important as well- your peers, and the environment you're in?

- Is it a separate school? What's with the affiliation?

- I was accepted to some engineering powerhouses out of HS- Michigan, Illinois, and GaTech, but didn't attend due to finances. Surprisingly, NYU was more affordable.

- How does NYU-Poly compare to the aforementioned schools?

- There's no BME major for undergrads. Or Materials Science. These are the majors/areas I'm interested in.

- I've been thinking of transferring out of NYU due to the aforementioned academic reasons, and for some other minor/non-academic ones as well. I'm considering Cornell, Hopkins, Rice, and Penn. Any reason why I should go for NYU-Poly versus these privates?

- If you are attending NYU-Poly, how has your experience been?

I was wondering what the Tisch admissions director would look at in terms of grades since my classes are going to be solely based on acting.

I got a 1970 on my SAT the second time I took it and I know it's on the lower side, but does it matter as much since I'm applying to Tisch? What exactly does Tisch look for in applicants?

UPDATE: I got my NYU packet today and it appears that I was in fact only admitted to the ""Core Studies Program"", rather than the actual CAS. I'm not terribly concerned about that fact other than the stigma I've heard that program is regarded with. Additionally, I received a scholarship that will award me $20,000 a year at any college of my choice, easing the financial burden of college slightly.

Now that I see that I didn't get into CAS proper, I'm considering my other two schools: BU for Econ/Poli Sci and GWU for Poli Sci.

I have a 10-12 week summer internship lined up in NYC (I go to university in Canada) and I'm looking for a place to stay this summer. 

I was referred to the NYU summer housing as I was told it's close to work (my internship is located in Times Square) and would greatly appreciate your input on a few things.

1) Is summer housing at NYU worth the price or should I look elsewhere? I'm thinking of applying for an apartment-style single bedroom at the Coral Towers. Cost is about $368 / week.

http://www.nyu.edu/summer/housing/overview_rates.htm

2) Which summer house is best, given that I'll be working in Times Square and prefer an apartment-style bedroom with access to a kitchen? Is there a noticeable difference between summer houses?

3) The apartment style bedrooms include a shared kitchen. How many people would share the same kitchen and bathroom?

I'm a first year grad student at Steinhardt, and basically after my first semester doing Speech Therapy, I'm realizing that I've made the wrong choice, and that I should have applied to Film School instead.

I talked to the Tisch people, and was told that I could apply to Tisch as an internal transfer student. BUT, to be considered a transfer student, I would need to be enrolled at Steinhardt for another semester full time. 

So, I am faced with a dilemma. Do I stay at Steinhardt (and brave the classes that I don't want to be taking, as well as a pretty large sum of loan money) and apply for a transfer to Tisch? Or do I quit NYU, and apply to Tisch as a regular student? 

Is there any benefit to being an internal transfer student? I know Tisch is extremely competitive. Would being a transfer student give me a better chance of getting in?

Please help me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time.",6,1352780781.0,/r/nyu/comments/133txo/internal_transfer_help/,None

Sure, I've made a pretty good group of friends and have fun during the weekends, but that's pretty much the extent of my enjoyment here at NYU. On the other hand, my weekly workload is enough to give me several mental breakdowns throughout the week – Writing the Essay, in particular. Not only is the work difficult, but I also feel that the information I have been learning is very dry and valueless, and I find myself dreading going to most of my classes. 

So, Seniors and Juniors (or even Sophomores), what do you think? Is this a usual first reaction and things will brighten up in the near future? Or is NYU just not the right place for me?

Any response is helpful.

I'm in my late 20s, and I just started college this fall at one of the CUNY schools. I'm doing well so far, and I like my classes, but I don't like the atmosphere very much. Not only is everyone around me ten years younger than I am (for the most part), but we're kind of treated that way, as well. Basically, it'd be nice to be around people a little closer to my age. For this reason, I am considering transferring to NYU's School for Continuing and Professional Studies. However, I've heard that it's not very academically credible, something which I consider paramount. If I do well here in the CUNY system, I could certainly transfer to NYU's CAS after a year or two, but I feel like I'd run into the same problem that I'm running into now: being surrounded by ""kids"" (no offense meant to anyone in their late teens).

Basically, I'm asking for some insight into these two schools. Is the SCPS really that bad, academically? Is the environment at the CAS tailored towards younger people? I know it sounds like I want to have my cake and eat it, too, but I'm really just trying to make the best possible decision, and I don't have very much information.

In terms of Gallatin, I am really not being challenged by the courses I am taking within Gallatin, and I feel like we spend each class talking about bullshit and don't make any progress. I came from a very formal education in high school, and people doing things like interrupting the teacher is very weird to me.

I've thought of transferring to CAS for comp sci, but is it then possible to double-major in something like dramatic writing? I'm thinking no. And I know minors exist of many of these things, but they're like 4 classes normally.

y3r1t,c3p-bro,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/y3r1t/thoughts_regarding_free_speech_and_censorship_on/,Thoughts regarding free speech and censorship on campus.,"Sorry that I'm late to the party on this one, but it slipped my mind until now.

I'm an NYU alum and have been following, to some extent, the recent Chick-Fil-A fiasco.  As most of you know, NYU houses the only Chick-Fil-A in the state of New York.  

When I was a student there, and continuing to this day, there was constant pressure from LGBT groups to ban Chick-Fil-A on campus due to their anti-homosexual stance. 

While I certainly don't agree with CEO Dan Cathy's opinions about homosexuality, I do believe that he has a right to those opinions. The opinions are held in earnest and they were likely a product of his upbringing and subsequent lifestyle choices.  They may not be what liberal 18-22 year old college students want to hear, they may be offensive, misguided, and even immoral, but this is his legitimate worldview. 

With that said, it bothers me that people are trying to ban the company on campus because they disagree with the opinions of the organization's CEO.  Chick-Fil-A exists at NYU because it turns a profit.  If the university was losing money because of Chick-Fil-A, or if Chick-Fil-A was losing money by having a location at NYU, it wouldn't exist, its as simple as that. This means that despite homophobic comments, NYU students still choose to eat at Chick-Fil-A.  Most students probably don't support the ban of Chick-Fil-A.  If they did, they wouldn't eat there and Chick-Fil-A would no longer have business and would be forced to close up shop.

In that light, it seems to me that efforts by LGBT organizations to ban Chick-Fil-A from campus are the opinions of a minority being forced on the majority without consent.  If students continue to eat there, the demand exists.  If this were a democratic process (and it can be, through the free market and voting with your dollar) then Chick-Fil-A would no longer exist once the majority of students decided that it shouldn't.  **As it stands, this is an effort by a small organization to circumvent the general opinion of the student body and ban an organization because you don't like what the CEO has to say.  This blatantly flies in the face of free speech and general democratic process.** Reddit in general scoffs at efforts by conservative groups to ban and companies after PRO-LGBT remarks, why is the reverse acceptable?

A boycott is great - if it works Chick-Fil-A will be forced to cease operating at NYU.  Educating people about Chick-Fil-A's homophobic stance is also great, if it strengthens the boycott, all the better.  But what it **not** okay is ignoring the rest of the student body and NYU community and trying to disallow speech that you do not agree with.  Free speech is free speech for all, even when the opinion is unpopular. Trying to ban free speech you disagree with is a tactic of repression.  We should be focusing on educating the population on the issues that are important to us - not sweeping the opinion of the other side under the rug.

I'd like to hear opinions on this.  I'd appreciate it if the discussion doesn't center around me being a homophobe, which I'm not, or around grammatical errors, which I'm sure I made.  I'm legitimately interested in what people think about this.

I was visiting New York city around the Xmas and New Year's season(Dec 2011 - Jan 2012). Needless to say, I had the time of my life and pretty much fell in love with the city. For a small town boy from New Zealand, NYC was the shizzle! 

Anyway, to my point, on Christmas day, when most establishments were closed, I ventured out to the NYU area in search of a pub to watch the Mavs vs Heat NBA opener. I did find a sole establishment open and went in and had a good time. For the life of me now I can't seem to remember the name or the exact location of the pub and would very much like to find out. Once back home, I'm in the habit of sending Thank You notes to the hotes/bars/restaurants I go to on my travels and have a good time in. 

Would you good people help me narrow my search if I provide a few details? 

* I remember walking to the NYU area from Midtown.
* The pub was on a quiet side street with it's entrance on the corner of two streets.
* It was a fairly standard ""English"" pub with wooden bar and interiors (tables, stools, that sorta thing).
* The only bartender was a very nice mid to late 20s girl with dark, curly hair. We got talking and she mentioned that she was Jewish and hence working on Christmas day. 
* I remember walking only a short distance (one block, at best) from the pub to the nearest subway entrance. 
* I either took the 8St-NYU yellow train or the Astor Pl green train only one stop north to Union Sq. I am fairly certain of this because I had to get to Union to take the L to Brooklyn, where I was put up. 

From my recollections I have managed to spot a couple of potential candidates: 
[Murphy & Gonzalez](http://www.murphy-gonzalez.com/) and [St. Mark's Ale House](http://stmarksalehouse.com/). The photos on both their websites look like that could've been it, but St. Mark's looks to be in the wrong location to how I remember the pub entrance. Murphy's looks a bit too up-market from the photos and I don't recall the interiors being that flash. 

I hope that all my rambling hasn't put you guys off. Your help in locating this fine watering hole would be very much appreciated and have me on my way to sending the last Thank You note left to send. Cheers!
