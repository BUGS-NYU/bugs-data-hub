It affords those with the right skills to stand out at a time when our profession is more competitive than ever. All writers need to be elastic.

After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nThis class is about live-drawing reporting and we\u2019ll teach writing and drawing in that context. Creativity and being open is the main prerequisite. Guided by award-winning illustrator and cartoonist Bob Eckstein, students will use cartoons, comic strips, illustrations and animation to tell a story more effectively. We\u2019ll explore your strengths and weaknesses, how to stand out in an ever increasingly competitive job market, and how to make yourself valuable. \n\nThe exercises and lessons are a lot of fun and live-drawing has never been bigger.

We\u2019ll be navigating this exciting new online format together. You\u2019ll learn how to write personal essays and profiles of people in the food industry. Together, we\u2019ll also grapple with a challenge many professional food writers are currently facing: How do you write about restaurants in a country without functioning restaurants? We\u2019ll pay particular attention to labor, turning to the stories of restaurant line cooks who\u2019ve suddenly found themselves jobless and grocery store workers who risk their lives to bring food to consumers. Guest speakers will include some of the most important voices working in food journalism.\n\nBy the end of the class, you\u2019ll be in a position to confidently pitch the story you\u2019re proudest of to a publication. Whether you\u2019d like to pursue food journalism as a career or merely get your feet wet in it, you\u2019ll fare well if you bring eagerness and a dose of healthy journalistic skepticism to every story you encounter. And you must have a good appetite.\n\nNotes: Counts as an elective for the journalism major and both journalism minors.", "prerequisites": "Include PreCollege Students"}, {"registrationNumber": 2637, "code": "062", "instructors": ["Clover G Hope"], "type": "Lab", "status": "WaitList", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-07-07 17:30:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-08-16 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-07-09 17:30:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-08-16 23:59:00"}], "waitlistTotal": 2, "name": "Elective Reporting Tpcs: Music!

Film! TV! Writing Popular Culture \n \n\n No prerequisites\n\nWriting about pop culture is a playground for radical thought, for exciting, often polarizing ideas on race, society, and how the fictional and fact-based entertainment we breathe intersects with real life. From reboots and reality TV to blockbusters and horror movies, from sitcoms and romcoms to the expansive landscape of minority-led Hollywood productions, from the latest Mitski album to Lizzo, there is no shortage of material to write about.\n\nThis course will help students sharpen their critical skills and instincts, write within a specific beat, and brainstorm good, pitchable ideas and story angles. Through writing assignments and occasional field reporting, students will brave the (internet) elements and learn to document pop culture, in the form of news blogs, reviews, interviews, criticism, and research.

Journalists are scrambling to cover the fate of the industry and people dependent on it; essayists are rethinking past adventures and longing for new ones; and forward-thinking writers are exploring how to travel without traveling. What comes of this work will impact the industry well beyond the return of non-essential flights and road trips, as wanderlust confronts concerns over overtourism and climate change.\n\nIn this course, we\u2019ll be approaching travel from all such angles. Some assignments will vary depending on where students are and how much local circumstances allow them to move around. Those in New York City who are able to leave home will use the diverse neighborhoods of the five boroughs as a proxy for the world; those able to go out in their own regions will choose areas culturally or geographically different from their own town or neighborhood as a destination. And students who are sheltering in place will have perhaps the most real-world task of all: re-inventing how to see, hear, feel and smell a faraway place \u2013 and meet \u201clocals\u201d \u2013 using a combination of technology and imagination. All students will produce travel content both traditional (service pieces, personal essays, guidebook entries) and digital (blogs, social media posts and YouTube videos).\n\nNot all travel content is journalism (ahem, press trips and fake TripAdvisor reviews), but the best is, and it follows the same ethical guidelines and shoulders the same responsibility>ties to readers and subjects. Students will read travel writers past and present and explore the ethical considerations of writing about places as destinations for (usually) privileged (mostly) Westerners.\n\nThe course is taught by Seth Kugel,  the former Frugal Traveler columnist for the New York Times and host of the Amigo Gringo YouTube channel.\n\nNotes: Counts as an elective for the journalism major and both journalism minors", "prerequisites": "Include PreCollege Students"}]}

In the process, we will explore how societies have turned to the divine, the celestial, and the transcendent to address social ails and imagine alternative futures.\n\nSome questions we will consider include: What makes a social movement \u201creligious\u201d? What makes a social movement a \u201crevolution?\u201d How have people turned to religion as a way to navigate the problem of \u201cjust\u201d and unjust violence? What connections exist between colonization, dispossession, land tenure, and religion? Why do revolts about land or freedom take on religious meaning? How does religion become a tool of narrative construction in times of conflict? How are narratives constructed about opponents\u2019 religions? How has religion and social hierarchy shaped which revolutions we remember and how we remember them? What visions of utopia have proved durable over time? Is there a hemispheric history of revolution, and do we have shared imaginings of new futures?"}]}

Most of you are reading this while sheltering-in-place, as Covid-19 highlights and deepens the unprecedented disparities between the haves and the have-nots in the United States. In these times, studying American history can give us the courage and knowledge to take effective action in the world around us.\n\nBy studying the two-hundred and fifty year tradition of American radicalism, and how it has in each generation inspired new people to reimagine and rebuild the unjust society around them, this course will allow you to find yourself within a long tradition of American radicals and dreamers and explore you own dreams of the future as well. Now, as the world is once again teetering on the brink, we can take hope from the lessons of successes and failures of people who devoted their whole lives to actualizing their dreams of better worlds.\n\nThis course will embark on a survey of the American radical tradition as a practical past, tracing it from the American revolution to the many revolutions of our lifetimes. Together, we will explore how some movements shaped, inspired and enabled lasting changes, while others failed to inspire and grow; and how a radical idealism runs from the earliest enslaved people campaigning against slavery through to the modern movements for socialism, queer liberation, environmental justice, prison abolition, and many others."}]}

{"name": "The Adolescent Paradox", "deptCourseId": "142", "description": "Adolescence is a remarkable time of growth and development; in just a few years, children transition dramatically towards adulthood across multiple domains. While adolescence is physically the healthiest period of the lifespan, it is also marked by an enormous rise in morbidity and mortality. This seeming paradox can be explained, in part, by biological and psychological changes during puberty that affect emotion regulation, cognition, and consequent risk-taking behavior.

{"name": "Law and Society", "deptCourseId": "1", "description": "An introduction to the study of law as a political practice. We treat law as a political practice from multiple disciplinary standpoints, examining how law and a range of legal institutions embody and constitute political, cultural, economic, and social forces. We examine the mobilization of rights, the use of litigation, and vernacular legal discourse, largely within the context of the United States, but with reference to transnational struggles. In the course of doing so, we study the relationship between making social policy and the use of litigation by social movements. Specifically, we study litigation strategies at the appellate and trial levels by focusing on three sociolegal movements: the civil rights movement, the women?s movement, and class action tort cases.

Moreover, they thought that only a politics focused on popular sovereignty, the liberation of human beings to collectively determine their own life, could overcome these forms of domination.

How are the intimate spaces of both human and nonhuman bodies \u2013 and their cultivation \u2013 related to notions of ecological violence?", "subjectCode": {"code": "ANST", "school": "UA"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 2672, "code": "001", "instructors": ["Jordan Sheridan"], "type": "Seminar", "status": "Closed", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-05-27 14:00:00", "minutesDuration": 175, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-06-01 14:00:00", "minutesDuration": 175, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}], "name": "Literature and the Environment Animals in the Anthropocene", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 4.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "CAS Graded", "location": "TBA"}]}

Topics include the theories of atomic structure; stoichiometry; properties of gases, liquids, solids, and solutions; periodicity of the properties of elements; chemical bonding; equilibrium; kinetics, thermodynamics; acid-base reactions; electrochemistry, coordination chemistry, and nuclear chemistry. The underlying unity of chemistry is a basic theme. Laboratories provide an introduction to basic techniques used in experimental chemistry. Many experiments use a computer interface to provide experience in modern methods of data collection and to allow thorough analysis of experimental results. Proper laboratory procedures, chemical safety rules, and environmentally sound methods of chemical disposal and waste minimization are important components of the course. Experiments are selected to provide illustration and reinforcement of course topics, including manual and automated titrations, basic chromatography, stoichiometry, thermodynamics, and colorimetry.", "subjectCode": {"code": "CHEM", "school": "UA"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 2397, "code": "001", "instructors": ["Stephanie Geggier", "John Michael Halpin", "Malgorzata Mandziuk"], "type": "Lecture", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-05-26 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 120, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-05-27 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 120, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-05-28 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 120, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-06-01 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 120, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}], "recitations": [{"registrationNumber": 2398, "code": "101", "instructors": ["Alan Robledo"], "type": "Recitation", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-05-26 11:15:00", "minutesDuration": 75, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-05-28 11:15:00", "minutesDuration": 75, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}], "name": "General Chemistry I & Laboratory", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 0.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "", "location": "TBA"}, {"registrationNumber": 2399, "code": "102", "instructors": ["Daisuke Kuroshima"], "type": "Recitation", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-05-26 11:15:00", "minutesDuration": 75, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-05-28 11:15:00", "minutesDuration": 75, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}], "name": "General Chemistry I & Laboratory", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 0.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "", "location": "TBA"}, {"registrationNumber": 2410, "code": "201", "instructors": ["Daisuke Kuroshima"], "type": "Lab", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-05-27 13:00:00", "minutesDuration": 255, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-06-01 13:00:00", "minutesDuration": 255, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}], "name": "General Chemistry I & Laboratory", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 0.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "", "location": "Brown Building - Room:151"}, {"registrationNumber": 2573, "code": "202", "instructors": ["Alexandra Mariel Dillon"], "type": "Lab", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-05-27 13:00:00", "minutesDuration": 255, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-06-01 13:00:00", "minutesDuration": 255, "endDate": "2020-07-05 23:59:00"}], "name": "General Chemistry I & Laboratory", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 0.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "", "location": "Brown Building - Room:151"}], "name": "General Chemistry I & Laboratory", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 5.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "CAS Graded", "location": "TBA", "notes": "STUDENTS MUST ALSO REGISTER FOR RECITATION AND LABORATORY SECTION.

The workshop meets twice a week for five weeks, morning or afternoon, on a Monday-Wednesday or Tuesday-Thursday schedule. Through the workshop process, students learn to become better critical readers of others' writing as well as their own; they learn to envision and complete a complex intellectual task in writing, one that requires both intuition and hard work, inspiration and revision; and they learn to attend to style in their writing as more than mere decoration. In the essay students write, they will be required to borrow an idea from one of six essays written by professional essayists and to deepen the readers\u2019 understanding of that idea by using two other essays and selected moments from experience. In doing this work students will learn to analyze written texts as sources of idea. In addition, they will learn to select and incorporate evidence from other written and visual texts to deepen the borrowed idea.

What is at stake in these repetitions? This course explores fashion as a means of processing history and time, a vehicle both activating and producing cultural memory. Building on Diana Taylor\u2019s idea of the archive and the repertoire, we will see how the history of fashion is just as much about novelty as it is about a negotiation between the present and the past and the performance of cultural memory. Starting from Coco Chanel\u2019s project of styling the nation and the not-so-new Dior\u2019s New Look we will move to contemporary reflections on the 60s and sartorial obsessions with retro and vintage in the age of Instagram. While the vogue has been deliberately constructed as a quintessentially French phenomenon, we will transit from Paris to New York, Nubia, and Deli, making a few stops in post-Soviet Moscow and Tbilisi. Rather than a depository of styles, fashion will be approached as an arena for performance and reinvention of nationhood and gender, local memory and practices of international consumption.

There are in-class presentations by local musicians and scholars, and students regularly attend performances throughout the city. The focus is on the everyday practices of musical life in New York City by both performers and listeners in a number of the City's musical constituencies: immigrant communities; amateur and professional music-makers; and popular, classical, and avant-garde scenes. Examination of these processes of music-making will be enhanced by a look at the histories of these different kinds of music-making. There will also be a historical discussion of the vibrant musical life of New York in the 19th and early 20th centuries, which will contribute to an understanding of why New York is seen, and sees itself, as a musical city.", "subjectCode": {"code": "MUSIC", "school": "UA"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 2355, "code": "001", "instructors": ["Robin E Preiss"], "type": "Lecture", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-07-06 11:00:00", "minutesDuration": 125, "endDate": "2020-08-16 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-07-07 11:00:00", "minutesDuration": 125, "endDate": "2020-08-16 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-07-08 11:00:00", "minutesDuration": 125, "endDate": "2020-08-16 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-07-09 11:00:00", "minutesDuration": 125, "endDate": "2020-08-16 23:59:00"}], "name": "Music of New York", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 4.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "CAS Graded", "location": "TBA", "notes": "Welcome to the occupied territory of Lenapehoking!

This class posits reading as an activity and explores reading and writing as reciprocal activities: no strong writers are not also strong readers.  What can we learn from a text's forms, modes, codes, and affects? What can we also learn from theories of literature (of poetry and poetics, or drama, of the novel or narrative in general)?   How can we read both with and against the grain? And how can a profound engagement with criticism, commentary, and theory help us become better \u201cmakers\u201d ourselves? This course assumes that writing is an effect of, and in a feedback loop with, reading:  thus this seminar aims to strengthen your capacities for pattern recognition \u2013 i.e. sophistication about genre, style, mode.

Today, the role of artistic representations in society, as well as the status of readers, writers, and critics, are fiercely debated topics, both in the classroom and across the social media multiverse. These transgressive questions continue to diffract through the many critical frameworks that they provoked in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including postcolonial, structuralist, poststructuralist, post-human, Marxist, feminist, queer, eco-critical, and critical race perspectives. These perspectives have transformed representations, discourse, and notions of education. As we approach them, we approach the realm of \u2018Theory.\u2019\n\nBut what is the definition of \"theory\u201d? And who gets to decide that? Often too philosophical for the literary critics, and too literary for the philosophers, theory itself has been a nomad, a migrant, an outcast heard protesting from outside the city walls. In many ways it has benefited from its institutional homelessness, leaving many of its most provoking questions about its own identity open-ended. Is theory always about writing? Need theory itself take the form of writing? How is theory different from \u2018critique\u2019 or \u2018analysis\u2019?

This dream deeply informs our psychic and political lives. In most cases American popular culture reproduces and even magnifies this myth rather than subject it to criticism. Economic downturns, lost wars, and social stagnation are rarely acknowledged in popular American cinema (without some redemptive factor), and abject failure is a surprisingly rare subject. Yet the Coen Brothers\u2014two of  the most critically acclaimed contemporary American filmmakers- have made failure their primary subject Their work abounds with losers, lost hopes, and broken dreams. They  challenge and rework established film genres\u2014the western, crime caper, film noir, musical, and even art house film\u2014as they disturb the ideology that drives these narrative forms. In this class we will examine how the genres of American film are structured by the American Dream, and how the Coens criticize its promise of prosperity, upward mobility, recognition, and fulfillment. In addition, we will explore how artists, social scientists, activists, and journalists have sought to portray an alternative (bleaker) view of American life.

What can its historical evolution teach us about innovation and durability, about why some technologies adapt and others fail or are lost? Students will tackle such questions as they explore how the wheel\u2019s applications were shaped by religion, war, social hierarchies, gender bias, economic efficiency, and the local terrain\u2014all while developing projects of their own.", "subjectCode": {"code": "CADT", "school": "UH"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 4918, "code": "001", "instructors": ["Ramesh Jagannathan"], "type": "Seminar", "status": "Closed", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-06-01 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-06-25 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-06-02 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-06-25 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-06-03 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-06-25 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-06-04 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-06-25 23:59:00"}], "name": "Reinventing the Wheel", "campus": "Abu Dhabi", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 4.0, "instructionMode": "In-Person", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "location": "Comp Research (A2-018)"}]}

At the same time, immigration and migration are among the most highly contested policy areas in Europe and beyond, viewed as principal drivers of public support for right-wing populist/extremist parties and the surge in nationalist, xenophobic attitudes. In this seminar, we will go beyond the slogans and headlines and delve into the actual politics of immigration and migration in Europe, drawing comparisons with other countries, including the U.S., where applicable. With a focus on the immigrant experience in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, we will analyze the laws and politics framing migration management at the EU and national levels; examine the consequences of the \u201cmigrants-as-threats\u201d securitization of migration paradigm; study the most\u2014and least\u2014effective social and labor market integration strategies; critically explore how governments accommodate cultural and legal diversity, especially how their policies\u2014think hijab and family laws\u2014affect women and LGBTQ (im)migrants; understand the rise of \u201cfemonationalism\u201d and the link between misogyny and Islamophobia; and, finally, learn how to effectively combat xenophobia and racism. A key goal of the seminar will be to shatter existing stereotypes of immigrants and minorities, particularly Muslim women, as being passive objects of state policies and to highlight their social and political agency. At the end of the seminar, students will have a basic understanding of the politics of (im)migration and integration in Western Europe and on the EU level, of the key issues and themes shaping the debates, policies and laws and, finally, of the creative ways in which immigrants and minorities exercise their political agency and create new spaces of citizenship for themselves."}]}

{"name": "Digital Marketing Analytics", "deptCourseId": "3310", "description": "The emergence of the Internet has drastically changed various aspects of a firm's operations. Some traditional marketing strategies are now completely outdated, others have been deeply transformed, and new digital marketing strategies are continuously emerging based on the unprecedented access to vast amounts of information about products, firms, and consumer behavior. From Twitter to Facebook to Google to Amazon to Apple, the shared infrastructure of IT-enabled platforms are playing a transformational role in today's digital age. The Internet is now encroaching core business activities such as new product design, advertising, marketing and sales, creation of word-of-mouth and customer service. It is fostering newer kinds of community-based business models. Traditional marketing has always been about the 4Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. This course will examine how the digital revolution has transformed all of the above, and augmented them with the 5th P of Participation (by consumers). While there will be sufficient attention given to top level strategy used by companies adopting social media and digital marketing, the focus of the course is also on analytics: how to make firms more intelligent in how they conduct business in the digital age. Measurement plays a big role in this space. The course is complemented by cutting-edge projects and various business consulting assignments that the Professor has been involved in with various companies over the last few years. We will learn about statistical issues in data analyses, assessing the predictive power of a regression, various econometrics-based tools such as simple and multivariate regressions, linear and non-linear probability models (Logit and Probit), estimating discrete and continuous dependent variables, count data models (Poisson and Negative Binomial), cross-sectional models vs. panel data models (Fixed Effects and Random Effects) and various experimental techniques that help can tease out correlation from causality such as randomized field experiments.", "subjectCode": {"code": "TECH", "school": "GB"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 4423, "code": "U1", "instructors": ["Anindya Ghose"], "type": "Lecture", "status": "WaitList", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-08-26 18:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-09-11 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-08-28 18:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-09-11 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-08-29 09:00:00", "minutesDuration": 420, "endDate": "2020-09-12 23:59:00"}], "waitlistTotal": 1, "name": "Digital Marketing Analytics", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 3.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "Grad Stern Graded", "location": "TBA", "prerequisites": "TECH-GB Departmental Max and Non-Stern"}]}

We will use the consultative selling model to understand the process of selling discovery of and alignment with customer's needs, presentations of solutions, overcoming objections, and gaining agreement. Rather than pigeonholing selling as \"something done by those sales types,\" we look at it as providing solutions to customer's problems. Selling is unique in that everyone does it. In business, we sell our products, proposals, IPOs, projects, budgets, and anything else that someone else has to approve. In life we buy cars and houses (buying and selling are two sides of the same coin), interview for jobs, propose marriage, and many other things that someone else has to say OK to. In short, selling is a fundamental life skill. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, case discussions, and many small group \"skills drills\" to apply the concepts and methods. In addition to learning the aspects of contemporary selling as it applies to their chosen careers, students will also gain a better appreciation of this important - and often misunderstood - aspect of an organization.

This MBA elective course is intended to inform managers analysts and consultants of the psychological processes and biases underlying our decision making with an emphasis on how to incorporate such insights into business strategies. Successful business strategies depend on a thorough understanding of how consumers and producers make decisions. However traditional models which are founded on the assumption of perfect rationality have serious limitations. Rather than making decisions in the manner predicted by these models consumers and producers often use myriad rules and processes that result in sometimes counterintuitive decisions. For instance consumers have an exaggerated tendency to select compromise or middle options when making choices overpay for warranties buy products they do not use and do not buy products that they later wish they had. Similarly producers overpay for acquisitions persist in investing in losing projects hire the wrong people and design products that result in consumer dissatisfaction. The fact many of these decision errors and biases are systematic has powerful business implications because as this course illustrates it is possible to address them. This course will provide a broad overview of important results from behavioral economics that clarify how consumers and producers really make decisions and investigate how these results can be leveraged to design original and more effective business strategies.", "subjectCode": {"code": "ECON", "school": "GB"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 4516, "code": "70", "instructors": ["Simon W Bowmaker"], "type": "Lecture", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-07-07 18:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-08-13 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-07-09 18:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-08-13 23:59:00"}], "name": "Behavioral Economics: Decisions and Strategies", "campus": "Washington Square", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 3.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "Grad Stern Graded", "location": "TBA", "prerequisites": "Prerequisite for part-time MBA: COR1-GB.1303.\nNot open to students with more than 24 ECON-GB units."}]}

Directors such as Martin Scorsese, Terrence Malick, Steven Spielberg, Brian de Palma, among others, established new ways to make and market films that earned the rubric of a 'New Hollywood.'

The course continues this examination up to and including such contemporary story models as Joseph Campbell's \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" as well as the current Hollywood paradigm, \"the three-act structure.\" We will seek to find those principles that form the backbone of successful narrative screenplays and contribute to a film's ability to resonate with an audience. The lecture is for analysis. The recitations are for applying what you have learned, through writing exercises and a completed short screenplay.

To achieve this, the class will delve into the methods, objectives, and technical aspects of post-production. It will thoroughly explore two major editing programs (Avid Media Composer and Adobe Premiere Pro) used in today's professional post-production environment, and acquaint the student with every stage of the editing workflow from capture to final output. Students will learn to approach these and other non-linear programs as variations on common themes rather than as completely new and foreign tools. In addition, the class will present examples of edited sequences from both narrative and documentary films for discussion, and have invited guests who will share their experiences in bringing films to completion.

The course begins with Physical\nComputing, which allows you to break free from both the limitations of\nmouse, keyboard & monitor interfaces and stationary locations at home or\nthe office. We begin by exploring the expressive capabilities of the human\nbody and how we experience our physical environment. The platform for the\nclass is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive\nsingle-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and make\nthings happen in the physical world. The core technical concepts include\ndigital, analog and serial input and output.\n\nThe second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer\nprogramming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions & objects) as\nwell as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing,\nnetworking, computer vision. The Javascript \u2018p5\u2019 programming environment is\nthe primary vehicle. P5 is more oriented towards visual displays on\ndesktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the\nphysical sensor & actuators from the first part of the class. The course is\ndesigned for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy\nwill allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to go further with\ntheir project ideas and collaborate with other students.\n\nWhat can computation add to human communication? You will gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the possibilities of computation\u2013\u2013 possibilities that will\naugment and enhance the perspectives, abilities and knowledge you bring\nfrom your field of study (e.g. art, design, humanities, sciences,\nengineering).

The course centers on learning all the elements of visual storytelling through a spectrum of aesthetic approaches. Working in virtual crews, students learn writing, directing, producing and editing skills as they each direct three short videos (three to five minutes in length) on their own cell phones or cameras.\n\nStudents will learn: all the techniques of visual storytelling (what is a shot, how do you frame it, and how does it tell a story; how to use sound design/music, lighting, editing, acting, production design, wardrobe and performance to tell a narrative story); the basics of a three-act classical dramatic structure (a script/story with a start, middle, and end and how to structure that); from past student examples as well as desktop films, found footage films, and films made online that are just as creative, narrative-driven, and compelling to watch as ones shot on location; how to cultivate your own unique and authentic artistic voice as a filmmaker, as the more you develop this the better your work will be (\u201cIn the most personal is the most creative\u201d - Bong Joon- ho, Parasite director and winner of 2019 Oscar); how to critique/talk critically and aesthetically about films, as understanding how to critique is a vital part of the learning process.\n\nStudents will also: watch clips from feature films and professional shorts to see how they use these storytelling elements in so many different ways to create the story they want to tell and create the experience that they want the audience to have; collaborate with each other throughout the class in virtual crews (collaboration will include brainstorming sessions about story ideas, asking for input on a script or shot list, remotely acting or recording voice over, shooting footage for a part of someone else\u2019s film, and giving feedback on a rough cut).\n\nCurrently, there is  a new Tisch-wide Remote Film, Video, Photo, and Media Production policy which requires that all filming, photography, sound, or media recording of any kind must be done inside of the student\u2019s personal residence until further notice, and no departmental equipment can be used. If students record onto media in their own place of residence, they must use their own cell phone, DSLR, web camera, or audio/media recording device. We will be monitoring the situation in New York and should anything change with this policy, we will update you.\n\nEven though these stricter shooting rules may be in effect for this class at the end of May, students will still learn all the technical and creative aspects of filmmaking as they would in an in-person class and be able to put these skills into practice to make three short films. Professor Fritz can give students access to the class website for this semester where they will be able to see past student work examples and get an idea of what the class will cover, and she is also available to set up a phone call or Zoom appointment anytime to talk over the details of this remote class.

{"name": "Acting for the Camera", "deptCourseId": "1908", "description": "Summer 2020: This course is an active workshop for actors who want to explore and cultivate their filmic talents, directors and writers who want to create performances that exploit the potential of the camera. Unique to acting for film is the intimate relationship between actor and camera. The actor/camera relationship is highlighted within the remotely taught environment. Prior acting experience and training is not required. Breaking down and filming scenes from television and film scripts, actors learn to make nuanced, authentic choices based on commitment to action, responsibility to text, investing in subtext and understanding what their physicality and behavior reveal. Being directed and watching others directed will give clarity to the role the actor plays in this visual storytelling process. The audition will be demystified through improvisation and practice of rehearsed and cold audition. Open Arts brings Acting For The Camera to a remotely conducted Zoom workshop platform this summer. Captured with Zoom\u2019s ever-presence, workshop participation will be a \u201clive\u201d experience of instruction, discussion and filming of work: on-screen exercises, rehearsals, improv, and multiple texts of directed performances of audition material and scenes. Each actor works on camera every session. The new workshop platform moves filming from almost exclusively in the \u201cStudio\u201d to shooting entirely \u201cOn-Location\u201d Shifting to \u201cOn-Location\u201d production, actors will be guided to make the simple technical adjustment to film their own work on a separate device, program or app. Self-shot filming is an opportunity to experiment with framing, using what props one may have on hand, and available spaces and lighting. Bringing production elements, building the frame with the director, the actor participates in the balancing of production detail with focus on their own performance. Placing themselves within the \u201cbigger picture\u201d will expand understanding of the actor\u2019s role in visual storytelling. Self-shot recorded footage, not exclusively being shot on Zoom, has the advantage of capturing a higher quality, closer to studio level footage, that is also not dependent on internet signal strength and connectivity at the time of recording.\n\nSpring/Fall 2020: This course is for actors who want to explore and cultivate their filmic talents, directors and writers who want to create performances that exploit the potential of the camera. Unique to acting for film is the intimate relationship between actor and camera. Experienced actors and those new to acting begin working before the camera the first class. Breaking down and filming scenes from television and film scripts, actors learn to make nuanced, authentic choices based on commitment to action, responsibility to text, investing in subtext and understanding what their physicality and behavior reveal. Being directed and watching others directed will give clarity to the role the actor plays in this visual storytelling process. The audition will be demystified through improvisation and practice of rehearsed and cold audition material. There will be an overview of the business aspects of professional acting, including casting and actor representation. The goal is to be a better screen actor, trust yourself, feel confident and be comfortable auditioning and working on professional sets in the future.

Please be sure to mention you are coming for the NYU Summer session to the receptionist.\n\nThe Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute offers students an introductory course to Lee Strasberg\u2019s Method, an acting technique in which personal experiences are used to create truth in imaginary circumstances.  Students are required to take two four-hour Method Acting classes with two different teachers in order to gain varying perspectives on their work.  The first half of each Acting class is devoted to a sequence of sensory exercises; the second half of class consists of scene and monologue work, during which time students apply what they have learned in their exercises to the roles on which they are working.  Improvisation is used to help create the habit of living through real experience.  This approach gives the acting student a conscious craft, while helping to prevent the inconsistencies that can plague the untrained actor.\nIn addition to the two four-hour acting classes, students choose from electives, which include Acting for Film and TV, Acting on Camera, Audition, Singing, Speech, Dialects, Vocal Production, Movement, Tai Chi, Physical Technique, Basic Dance, Jazz, Tap, Ballet, Script Analysis, Shakespeare at the Globe, Theatre History and others.  Studio classes encompass the full range of today\u2019s acting medium, including on-camera work in a state-of-the-art digital film studio, and electives are consistently updated, as well as added, in order to stay cutting edge and relevant in the evolving professional landscape of theatrical arts.\nIf you are interested in taking this course please set up an Interview with Emily Kirn: emily@strasberg.edu"}]}

How do different theatrical forms (comedies of manners, theatre of the absurd, devised theatre, docudrama, performance writing), reflect changing anxieties about social life, power, and truth? How are categories of difference \u2014 such as race, religion, gender, sexuality, and class \u2014 constructed, critiqued, or parodied on the stage? In what ways is the artform of theatre uniquely suited to explore these issues? In addition to studying the plays themselves, we will pay particular attention to the cultural and institutional frameworks promoting or preventing their production: censorship laws, the allocation of Arts Council funding, and recent controversies around issues of free speech and offense. Playwrights covered include Noel Coward, Samuel Beckett, Caryl Churchill, Tom Stoppard, Sarah Kane, Kwame Kwei-Armah, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, and debbie tucker green.\n\nOpen to all students during summer.", "prerequisites": "Restriction for THEA-UT 604"}]}

When Lydia Thompson and the British Blondes brought their unique brand of burlesque to New York City in 1868, the public understanding of burlesque transformed from a literary form to a performance style, and the worlds of \u201cleg shows\u201d and burlesque became largely synonymous in the public imagination. These early burlesque shows were evening-length parodies of classical texts or myths, and focused on women \u201cputting on\u201d the other gender (rather than its later association with \u201ctaking off\u201d via striptease).\nThis course will cover some of the major historical shifts in American burlesque traditions including Thompsonian burlesque (and those that followed), female minstrel shows, hootchy cootchie dance, burlesque wheels, emergence of striptease, queens of burlesque, exotic dancing, and the neo-burlesque movement. Rather than codify the defining characteristics and time periods of these historical moments, we will seek to understand and trace how the definitions, conceptual preoccupations, and performance techniques of burlesque have adapted and changed over time. Special consideration will be given to understanding burlesque in relationship to other entertainment genres such as vaudeville, minstrelsy, early film, melodrama, musical theatre, world\u2019s fairs, and to the larger social, cultural, and historical contexts in which burlesque has taken place. We will watch films that document burlesque; read biographies of major figures and scholarly work about burlesque, theatre, and popular culture; attend neo-burlesque performances; and discuss the neo-burlesque and performance art movements with guest artists.\nWe will think, read, write, and discuss (a lot) in this class about \u201dbig topics\u201d such as gender, performance, desire, sexuality, class, race, camp, nationalism, fashion, censorship (etc.) via the signifier of the burlesque body.

The tutorial group meets regularly throughout the semester, and students follow a common syllabus: all participants complete the same readings, write papers on similar topics, etc.  Students in the same tutorial must register for the same number of credits.  Credit is determined by the amount of work (readings and other types of assignments) and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course.  Tutorials range from 2 to 4 credits.  Meeting hours correspond to course credits: a 4-credit tutorial requires at least fourteen contact hours per term between the teacher and students.

{"name": "Journalism and Society in China", "deptCourseId": "203", "description": "This four credit course examines the role and functions of journalists and the media in Chinese society as modern reporting moves into the digital media landscape. To provide context to the political and cultural environment of news-gathering, the course assesses the development of journalism in China through the 20th century from around the birth of the Republic of China (1911) and through to the modern era. It will examine the relatively free publishing environment for newspapers in the lead-up to establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (1949) and the imposition of government control thereafter. Through providing an understanding of the parallel publishing environment of institutional traditional media ownership and today\u2019s free-enterprise online media corporations, the unit studies how reporters operate in both. Students will gain an understanding of the strong nexus between government and media and the ever-present need for journalists to portray various aspects of Chinese ideology at the same time as functioning as news reporters. The portrayal of media as propagandist will be considered against the abiding devotion of journalists to lift the veils on truth. The roles, functions and rounds of journalism as practiced in China will be studied through class discussion and assignments and these will include reporting across all publishing platforms of politics, business, the environment and national issues. The impact of digital journalism will be an underlying theme through the course. The course structure will involve lectures, workshops, seminars, guest speakers and an industry visit. There will be two 3-hour classes per week. Assignments will include a blend of in-class group and individual presentations and two written papers.", "subjectCode": {"code": "JOUR", "school": "SHU"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 5394, "code": "001", "instructors": ["David William Maguire"], "type": "Seminar", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-05-26 13:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-07-03 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-05-28 13:00:00", "minutesDuration": 180, "endDate": "2020-07-03 23:59:00"}], "name": "Journalism and Society in China", "campus": "Shanghai", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 4.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "location": "TBA", "notes": "This course fulfills GCS Chinese Media, Arts, and Literature"}]}

Each class session may include a variety of activities, including: discussion, in-class reading and writing, role-playing, and other participatory exercises. These various activities will be designed and facilitated by the instructor to allow students to engage in a reflective dialogue. These discussions draw from three different sources: 1) the students\u2019 own personal experiences and values; 2) expert insights drawn from a variety of academic disciplines including philosophy, literature, history, and art, as well as the natural and social sciences; and 3) relevant business cases. In each class session, students consider a set of expert accounts identified by the instructor as starting points for discussion, and then they integrate their experiences with business cases that have personal relevance for them. The overarching themes of this dialogue include: 1) the relationship between business and society on a global, national and local basis; 2) the foundations of personal and professional business ethics; and 3) the exercise of leadership in organizations.

We begin by exploring the\nexpressive capabilities of the human body and how we experience our\nphysical environment. The platform for the class is a microcontroller\n(Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be\nembedded anywhere and sense and make things happen in the physical world.\nThe core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and\noutput.\n\nThe second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer\nprogramming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions & objects) as\nwell as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing,\nnetworking, computer vision. The Javascript 'p5' programming environment is\nthe primary vehicle. P5 is more oriented towards visual displays on\ndesktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the\nphysical sensor & actuators from the first part of the class.\n\nThe course is designed for computer programming novices but the\nproject-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the\nopportunity to go further with their project ideas and collaborate with\nother students.

We\u2019re trading an increasingly hostile natural environment for a socially networked and commercially driven artificial one. Whether it's the bedrooms of YouTube streaming stars, the augmented Pokestops of Pokemon Go, the virtual tourism of the latest humanitarian crisis or even the \"airspace\" of Airbnb; we are witnessing a dramatic transformation of what occupying space means.\n\nSo where are these dramatic spatial paradigm shifts occurring? Who owns and occupies these spaces? Who are the architects and what historical and ethical foundations are they working from? What world do they want to build for humanity and where does the creative individual fit into it? Will it be a walled garden, a role-playing adventure or a tool for creating more worlds?\n\nThe course will ask students to embrace the role of virtual architect, not in the traditional brick-and-mortar sense of constructing shelter, but in terms of the engagement with the raw concept of space. However, this virtual space must be considered and evaluated as a \u201csite\u201d that is activated and occupied by real people and all the limitations of physical space that they bring with them from the real world. This is the foundation of synthetic architecture; simulated space met with biological perception.\n\nThis conceptual architecture is free from the confines of physics but host to a whole new set of questions : How do we embrace the human factors of a dimensionless environment? How do we make or encourage meaningful interactions within the limits of current technology? New models of interaction must inform and shape the architecture of virtual space - what does that look like? How can architecture and aesthetics inform the creation of virtual environments and immersive narratives? How do we acutely consider the psychological and social impacts of the worlds we design and what is the metaphorical ground plane to make sense of this virtual world, unbound by physics?", "subjectCode": {"code": "ITPG", "school": "GT"}, "sections": [{"registrationNumber": 4271, "code": "001", "instructors": ["Jonathan Turner"], "type": "Lecture", "status": "Open", "meetings": [{"beginDate": "2020-07-07 12:10:00", "minutesDuration": 175, "endDate": "2020-08-13 23:59:00"}, {"beginDate": "2020-07-09 12:10:00", "minutesDuration": 175, "endDate": "2020-08-13 23:59:00"}], "name": "Synthetic Architectures", "campus": "Brooklyn Campus", "minUnits": 0.0, "maxUnits": 4.0, "instructionMode": "Online", "grading": "Grad Tisch Pass/Fail", "location": "TBA", "notes": "To enroll, please contact Dante DelGiacco at dpd266@nyu.edu.", "prerequisites": "Restr for ITPG  - GT (BLANK)"}]}

{"name": "Large Format", "deptCourseId": "2014", "description": "Prerequisite: Photography & Imaging: Analog and Digital. Please see the Notes section below.\n\nMany artists turn to 4x5 and 8x10 large-format cameras for the creative control that view cameras afford, as well as for the high resolution and potentially large scale of the resulting prints. This course introduces the special characteristics of large format photography, including perspective control, creative approaches to selective focus and metering strategies facilitated by single negative processing. The exposure and development methods known as the Zone System will also be considered. Because large format work is physically demanding and relatively slow, this is also an opportunity to work more deliberately and, in some respects, more consciously. It may also inform one\u2019s understanding of the methods and approaches of 19th and early 20th Century artists. \n\nThe high resolution of large format description can often produce a compelling image of relatively static subject matter that might not otherwise succeed if recorded in smaller formats. Surfaces and details evoke a more \u201ccomplete\u201d, or even tactile appreciation of some subjects. Following a series of practical exercises during the first half of the course, students are expected to develop an appropriate project on which to concentrate and apply their evolving skills in the production of an original and integrated body of work. Technical material covered includes different large format camera types and applications, lenses and optics, metering, filters, special B&W developers, large format printing and scanning for digital output. Early historical processes are introduced, current exhibitions of artists and photographers in New York are discussed and field trips are arranged.

{"name": "Acting for The Camera", "deptCourseId": "2908", "description": "Summer 2020: This course is an active workshop for actors who want to explore and cultivate their filmic talents, directors and writers who want to create performances that exploit the potential of the camera. Unique to acting for film is the intimate relationship between actor and camera. The actor/camera relationship is highlighted within the remotely taught environment. Prior acting experience and training is not required. Breaking down and filming scenes from television and film scripts, actors learn to make nuanced, authentic choices based on commitment to action, responsibility to text, investing in subtext and understanding what their physicality and behavior reveal. Being directed and watching others directed will give clarity to the role the actor plays in this visual storytelling process. The audition will be demystified through improvisation and practice of rehearsed and cold audition. Open Arts brings Acting For The Camera to a remotely conducted Zoom workshop platform this summer. Captured with Zoom\u2019s ever-presence, workshop participation will be a \u201clive\u201d experience of instruction, discussion and filming of work: on-screen exercises, rehearsals, improv, and multiple texts of directed performances of audition material and scenes. Each actor works on camera every session. The new workshop platform moves filming from almost exclusively in the \u201cStudio\u201d to shooting entirely \u201cOn-Location\u201d Shifting to \u201cOn-Location\u201d production, actors will be guided to make the simple technical adjustment to film their own work on a separate device, program or app. Self-shot filming is an opportunity to experiment with framing, using what props one may have on hand, and available spaces and lighting. Bringing production elements, building the frame with the director, the actor participates in the balancing of production detail with focus on their own performance. Placing themselves within the \u201cbigger picture\u201d will expand understanding of the actor\u2019s role in visual storytelling. Self-shot recorded footage, not exclusively being shot on Zoom, has the advantage of capturing a higher quality, closer to studio level footage, that is also not dependent on internet signal strength and connectivity at the time of recording.\n\n\nSpring/Fall 2020: This course is for actors who want to explore and cultivate their filmic talents, directors and writers who want to create performances that exploit the potential of the camera.

The audition will be demystified through improvisation and practice of rehearsed and cold audition material.

{"name": "Fundamentals of Filmmaking I: The Art of Visual Storytelling", "deptCourseId": "2560", "description": "Summer 2020: This remote practical workshop is designed to introduce students to the techniques and theory of developing and directing short film ideas that are shot on digital video using their own cell phones or cameras and edited with Adobe Premiere Pro software. The course centers on learning all the elements of visual storytelling through a spectrum of aesthetic approaches. Working in virtual crews, students learn writing, directing, producing and editing skills as they each direct three short videos (three to five minutes in length) on their own cell phones or cameras.\n\nStudents will learn: all the techniques of visual storytelling (what is a shot, how do you frame it, and how does it tell a story; how to use sound design/music, lighting, editing, acting, production design, wardrobe and performance to tell a narrative story); the basics of a three-act classical dramatic structure (a script/story with a start, middle, and end and how to structure that); from past student examples as well as desktop films, found footage films, and films made online that are just as creative, narrative-driven, and compelling to watch as ones shot on location; how to cultivate your own unique and authentic artistic voice as a filmmaker, as the more you develop this the better your work will be (\u201cIn the most personal is the most creative\u201d - Bong Joon- ho, Parasite director and winner of 2019 Oscar); how to critique/talk critically and aesthetically about films, as understanding how to critique is a vital part of the learning process.\n\nStudents will also: watch clips from feature films and professional shorts to see how they use these storytelling elements in so many different ways to create the story they want to tell and create the experience that they want the audience to have; collaborate with each other throughout the class in virtual crews (collaboration will include brainstorming sessions about story ideas, asking for input on a script or shot list, remotely acting or recording voice over, shooting footage for a part of someone else\u2019s film, and giving feedback on a rough cut).\n\nCurrently, there is  a new Tisch-wide Remote Film, Video, Photo, and Media Production policy which requires that all filming, photography, sound, or media recording of any kind must be done inside of the student\u2019s personal residence until further notice, and no departmental equipment can be used. If students record onto media in their own place of residence, they must use their own cell phone, DSLR, web camera, or audio/media recording device. We will be monitoring the situation in New York and should anything change with this policy, we will update you.\n\nEven though these stricter shooting rules may be in effect for this class at the end of May, students will still learn all the technical and creative aspects of filmmaking as they would in an in-person class and be able to put these skills into practice to make three short films. Professor Fritz can give students access to the class website for this semester where they will be able to see past student work examples and get an idea of what the class will cover, and she is also available to set up a phone call or Zoom appointment anytime to talk over the details of this remote class.
